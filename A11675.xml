            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GH our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould not onely whet their tongues and ſwords, but alſo dippe their pennes in the gall of bitterneſſe, and every day write a book againſt us in this cauſe, yet will it bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of us, as an ornament to our head, and a chain to our neck; for not wee ſo much as trueth it ſelfe doth ſuffer by them; It being their ayme and deſigne to make Antichriſtian errour triumph above that truth, which is coaeval with time it ſelf, &amp; their Art &amp; ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning not only to conceal &amp; deprave verities, which will prove the daughters of time, but alſo to forge ſuch lies, as may ſerve moſt for their wicked ends; But it wounds us
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17384:3"/>ſore, that they are permitted to prefixe the ſacred face and name of authoritie, ordained of God to defend and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate trueth, to their baſe and crooked wayes, and that by their Sophiſtications, as the goings of the Serpent, the world ſhould be obfirmed in errour, and the ſimple and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant pitifully ſeduced and ſnared, to be made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the execution of their malice and crueltie. Wee may truely ſay, if forgeries, depravations, and miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were taken out of the minds and libells of our adverſaries in this cauſe, they would bee but poore and ſhrunken things, unpleaſing to themſelves, when they look upon them, and of ſmall power to worke upon others that heare them; but they finde that this miſerable mixture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though agroſſe embaſement, maketh their mettall the more pliant and flexible, and to worke the better for making up their Idoll.</p>
            <p>That book which carried the name and title of <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties large Declaration,</hi> hath yet received no publîck and particular anſwer. So many as are acquainted with our proceedings ſince the beginning of this worke, as have taken diligent heed to ſuch pieces of ours, as it hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed, which alone may be an antidote againſt all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of it, and as have peruſed what beſide came from us, to the view of the world, do find that it hath nothing againſt the cauſe, or againſt the perſons of men, but what they are able to confute from their owne knowledge. Before that Declaration was ſeene of us, (for it was not intended to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our eyes, but to dazell the ſight of our neighbours, and therefore a long time kept without our borders) we had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto his Majeſtie and the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction concerning our proceedings which were perverted by the author of that <hi>Declaration,</hi> the pacification was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and an Aſſembly and Parliament promiſed and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17384:3"/>appointed: Like as at the time of the pacification, diverſe of his Majeſties gracious expreſsions were found contrary to the aſperſions and blotts which had fallen from that foul pen. And this at that time was told his Majeſtie by ſome of our Commiſsioners, and did teach us how impudent the forger was, and how injurious to the King, from whoſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice wee hoped he ſhould receive his deſerved cenſure and puniſhment, at the deſire and ſupplication of the Aſſembly and Parliament, which was judged to be a more generous way and more honourable for the King, the Kingdome, and many particular perſons, who were knowne to bee wronged, then to trifle with ſuch a party in a reply about things that were paſt, and to make the wounds green, which were begunne to cloſe; Neither in this was it our deſire, ſo much to do the party hurt, as to make him repent and pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, without which wee cannot yet ſee, how either his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie can be reſtored to his honour, or the Kirk and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and many of his Majeſties ſubjects repaired in their credite; Although wee know that this our plaine and open profeſsion of our judgement and deſire wîll make him (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God touch his heart) the more deſperatly wicked; and if he have any power, to abuſe it, that he be not called to that reckoning which he is not able to make.</p>
            <p>The caſe is now changed, It was time then to keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and now it is time to ſpeake, when our just excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against this late <hi>Declaration,</hi> and our preſenting of the naked and open truth, as in day light without maskes and mummeries, may (if the Lord will) prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief now intended the ſecond time, which was by other meanes in the mercy of God turned away at firſt. And if this our endeavour ſhall proue uneffectuall to our wiſhed ends of tranquillity and peace, we muſt reſt upon the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Supreame providence, and upon this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17384:4"/>that we have delivered our own ſoules. The ſteps of the Declaration ſhall be trod by us, In the relation of our proceedings from the pacification to the Parliament, In the time of the ſitting of the Parliament, and after the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this day: In all which, when the Declaration wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth out of the way, we ſhall modeſtly, and with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which we owe to authority, which ſhall never be vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but ever be in high eſteem with us, keepe the way of truth, and ſhal note the wilfull aberrations of our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whoſe delight is to walk in wanderings and by-paths.</p>
            <p>The queſtion proponed in the beginning: who they are that have been the diſturbers of the peace, is that which we deſire to be debated, and may be the more eaſily and clearly defined, upon this threefold conſideration. Firſt, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation in Religion, and the infringing of fundamentall Liberties and Lawes, which are univerſally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the maine cauſes of commotions, have been the firſt motives and meanes of our Tempeſts and troubles: When Religion and Juſtice, which are the pillars of government begin to be ſhaken or under-myned, no marvell there be diſturbance in the houſe of the Common-wealth, which yet is not to be imputed to all who are under the roofe, but to ſuch as have a hand, and are workers in the miſchief. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our wayes of redreſſe and deliverance from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ruine, were no other, but humble and frequent ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the Councell of the Kingdome firſt, and not being heard, in all reverence to the King himſelf, as the great Master of the houſe fair &amp; legall proteſtations against the threatning &amp; preſsing evils, every one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bearing the teſtimonies of our loyaltie, &amp; of our high honouring of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall government in the Royall perſon of our native King: And when our ſupplications &amp; proteſtations proved nothing but fewell to that fire, which was burning in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17384:4"/>breaſts of thoſe Incendiaries our enemies, and had infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our King to take armes againſt us, and to put all in a common combuſtion; We did ſtill preſent in the one hand our humble ſupplications, moſt earneſtly begging to injoy our Religion and Liberties, in peace, under his Majeſties happy government: And did hold in the other hand, the ſword of juſt and innocent defence, againſt the oppreſsion and violence of the Enemies of the Kings honour, and of our peace; Which we are confident by no Law of God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, can be judged to be rebellion or laeſ-Majeſty. Our petition, at that time when we are ſaid to have been in the hight of rebellion, we have here ſet down whole, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration containing but a part thereof. We did then write our mind, whereof we never did repent, and which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be known to all men.</p>

                           <item>2.

            <p>After much agitation, and many conſultations, his Majesties Declaration touching the intended pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was read to our Commiſsioners; who upon their diſlike and exceptions taken both at matter and expreſsions, as contrary to our minds, and prejudiciall to our cauſe, did humbly remonſtrat, that the Declaration as it was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, could not give ſatisfaction to us from whom they were ſent; His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to command ſome words to be deleted, other words to be changed, and many parts thereof were by verball promiſes and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from his Majeſties own mouth mitigated, which in our eſtimation were equall to that which was written, ſome of the Counſellours of <hi>England,</hi> aſſuring our Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, that what was ſpoken and promiſed before men of honour, and in the face of two Armies, was no leſſe certain, and would (no doubt) be as really performed, as if it had

Thus, way was made to the pacification, and for praeoccupying all miſtakes whether wilfull poſsibly by ſome, or through weakneſſe of memory by others: Theſe vocall interpretations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions were collected, keeped by our ſelves, and in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers delivered to ſome of the Counſellours of <hi>England</hi> in the words follow-ing.</p>

His Majeſtie contended; that his Aſseſsours had vote, and upon an expreſsion in his Majeſties Declaration, that referred to ſome reaſons contained in former Proclamations, which were total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the lawfulnes of ruling Elders: It was deſired that according to the cuſtome of this Kirk, all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies ariſing, ſhould be remitted to the Aſsembly it ſelf, His Majeſtie had ſome expreſſions craving theſe to be remitted to himſelf, but being told that it was againſt the conſtitutions of the Kirk, to have any other Judge, but the voycer of the aſsembly, where his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, or his Commiſſioner ſhould be preſent, and give the firſt voyce; It was concluded, that the word <hi>Free Aſſembly</hi> in his Majeſties Declaration, did import the freedome in judging all queſtions ariſing there, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning conſtitution, members or matter.</p>

            <p>Neither was the refuſing of the Lords and others ſent for, the true cauſe of his Majeſties going away: What means have been uſed by ſome bad inſtruments to diſturb and cut off a treatie of peace, is too manifeſt from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of times paſt; when men ſimulat and make a ſhow to do that of a free mind, which indeed neceſsitie conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to do for the time, there can bee no firme peace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Wicked men alſo who find themſelves prejudged by a treatie of peace, have found no way more certain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, then to go about to commit ſome foul act againſt them, with whom they would not have the accord to ſtand: And it hath rarely come to paſſe, that the beſt Princes have been ſuffered by male-contents to keep the conditions of peace, which they have made with their own ſubjects; For here it is no great difficulty, to foment diviſion, and to make an exulceration in the mind of Soveraignitie. We will not expreſſe what by relation, and not by conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but by îndicative ſignes we learned at that time; But will onely give the cauſes why the fourteen ſelect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons called for by his Majeſty, were not ſuffered to goe to <hi>Barwick.</hi>

                        <head>Some few of the many reaſons given for ſtaying the Noblemen and others named by his Majeſty from repairing at this time to the Court at <hi>Barwicke.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. HIs Majeſty hath not been in uſe at any time of the greateſt ſecuritie to call any of his Majeſties Subjects out of the Kingdome after this ſort: At this time then which is ſo full of feares, to call for ſo many of ſuch Noblemen, without any warrant or command ſent to themſelves, it ſeemes to us ſtrange, and may we not ſay, was ever his Majeſty, or his Royall Father wont to do ſo unto us, ſince their going to <hi>England</hi> unto this day? Although his <hi>Majeſties Declaration</hi> at <hi>Dunce,</hi> contrair to our mind and merit, did call the late Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, a <hi>pretended Aſſembly,</hi> our humble and loyall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, diſorders; our courſes, diſagreeable to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall governement; and did threaten us with the terrours of his Majeſties wrath; yet our deſire is to live a quiet and peaceable life under his Majeſties governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our zeale to his Majeſties honour, although with ſome aſperſion put upon our ſelves before the world, moved us to receive them, becauſe of diverſe gracious expreſſions related from his Majeſties mouth by our Commiſſioners, which we did gladly heare, and did note diligently for our own content, and that wee might be able to ſatisfie others, and without which, the articles of pacification had never ſerved for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of peace; yet we now underſtand, that all, or the greater part of theſe verball expreſſions are denyed, which makes our hopes to waver, giveth us great cauſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17384:12"/>of Jealouſie and ſuſpition, and moveth us to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion all other reports made to us from his Majeſty.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. His Majeſtie knoweth, that what is ſo inſtantly preſſed at this time, was none of the articles agreed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon at that time. And if beſide the reſtitution of goods, the rendring of the Caſtles, the diſſolving of the Army; It had then been required that thoſe fourteen ſhould be ſent to the Camp, or to <hi>Barwicke,</hi> the condition had beene harder then that wee could have yeelded unto it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe we cannot judge the intentions of minds, and diſpoſition of hearts, but by that which we heare with our eares, and doeth appeare in action. We deſire to be conſidered, that all expreſſions of favour are put upon our adverſaries, they eſteemed and called his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties good Subjects; and their practiſes, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſervice; Upon the contrair, whole volumes are ſpred, and even ſince the treatie put in all hands againſt us, not onely ſtuffed with ſuch reproaches againſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole Kingdome, and particularly againſt the perſons now ſent for: That it were a diſhonour to the King to have ſuch a Kingdome, and a ſhame to bee ſet over ſuch ſubjects as we are deſcryved to bee; But alſo containing threatnings and vowes of exemplar pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon ſuch as they are reported to be: That the troubles of the Northerne parts of the Kingdome are not as yet ceaſed: That Garriſons are kept at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick:</hi> and other places of the borders: That the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> is fortified, and furniſhed above any thing that hath been heard of at any time before: That ſome cruell and bloody words againſt the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords have been over-heard in <hi>Barwick:</hi> and, which we could not have beleeved, but that it is teſtified by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17384:12"/>ſo many Letters ſent hither; That our friends and Countreymen not onely in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but even now in <hi>England,</hi> are not only ſtopped in their trade, but caſten in priſon for the modeſt refuſing to take oathes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair to their oath and Covenant, which they have ſworne in their own Countrey: a violence not uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the treatie of peace, contrair to the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the rule of common equitie, of doing that to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which we would they ſhould doe unto us, and to the articles of pacification agreed upon with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie.</p>
                        <p>Theſe and other the like conſiderations doe ſo work upon us, that for the preſent except we doe againſt our own hearts, and deny our owne ſenſe, wee cannot give way to ſo eminent perſons to repair to <hi>Barwick,</hi> which we truſt his Majeſtie neither will interpret to be diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, nor diffidencie, ſince we have been all carefull to ſee all the conditions performed to the uttermoſt on our part. and there is not one of that number, nor of us all, but ſhall bee ready for our owne parts, to give the moſt ample teſtimony of our obedience to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties commandements, and of our confidence in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Juſtice and goodneſſe, as his Majeſtie ſhall real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find, and experience at his coming, and during his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the Kingdome: For wee are aſſured what hath been committed by any ſince the begunne pacification, contrair to any of the articles thereof, hath proceeded from the diſpoſition of wicked inſtruments about his Majeſtie, who are enemies of his Majeſties honour, and our peace, and have been the authors of all our wofull diviſions, which we beſeech the Lord to put to an end, by an happy and everlaſting peace.</p>

            <p>The darkneſſe of thoſe clouds which than threatned the ſtorme now like to fall upon this Iland, had been eaſily ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the brightneſſe of his Majesties preſence in his Royall perſon, which would have been ſo farre from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (as the Lord is witneſſe, never any ſuch treacherous intention or motion entred in our hearts) that never was there a King more heartily welcomed, more chearfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, and more univerſally accompanied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations, and acclamations of joy; then his Majeſty would have been, if he had come and ſtayed in this his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdome, till that had been performed in Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Parliament, which was promiſed in the articles of pacification; But God would not have it ſo: And his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhew to our Commiſsioners, That weighty affairs of the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> did call for his Majeſties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, whereof he had received advertiſement from the Councell of that Kingdome: But that he would appoint a Commiſsioner in his place, fully inſtructed for the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Parliament. By all which it is apparent, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any tumult in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> nor the not coming of the Noblemen and others called for, was ſo much as preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at that time, to be the change of his Majeſties reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Having now repreſented, that the Innovation of our Religion, and the infringing of our Liberties, were the firſt cauſes &amp; motives of our troubles. Secondly, that we did hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

We come to our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17384:13"/>third conſideration to vindicat our ſelves from the breach of peace, which we truſt will be a work very eaſie for us in the minds of ſo many as will be pleaſed to judge unparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and without prejudice to heare the plain trueth: For nothing is now after ſo many dayes, and ſo hard dealing layde to our charge, which was not before his Majeſties parting from <hi>Barwick,</hi> both objected by our adverſaries, and ſo fully anſwered by our Commiſsioners ſent from us, that his Majeſty was pleaſed to continue in his purpoſe, and to renew his Royall promiſe of holding the Aſſembly and Parliament: If his Majesty was not then ſatisfied without anſwers, how was it that the Aſſembly and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, the ſumme of all our deſires were ſtill granted: and if his Majeſty was then ſatisfied with our anſwers, how co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it that we ſhould be charged with the ſame aſperſions which were purged before. This Sophisticall wrangling, and groſſe wronging of the truth, may perhaps gaine ſome ground upon the credulity of ſtrangers, who are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the order of our proceedings, but can have no power with us, or with others who were witneſſes to our wayes, but to make us the more affectionat to the cauſe, and them more affectionat to us, whom they know to bee borne down, not onely by violence, but by calumnies and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Wee preſent therefore in this place both the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles where with we were charged 1639. July 18. and the anſwers given unto them.</p>

                           <p>To the third, Since his Majeſtie will have that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment disbanded, the ſame ſhall be done preſently; But wee humbly beg, that his Majeſtie would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17384:15"/>to diſmiſſe the Garriſons in <hi>Barwick, Carlill,</hi> and the reſt of the borders.</p>

And yet for to ſhew their readineſſe to give his Majeſtie all contentment, they ſhall before the Parliament, cauſe make a ſlope or two in the Fortifications, which if his Majeſty and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament find that they ſhalbe caſten downe, It muſt bee at the Kings Majeſties, and not upon their charges.</p>
                           <p>To the ſixth, It is denyed that any meetings are keeped, but ſuch as are agreeable to the acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and although wee muſt adhere to our moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar and lawfull Covenant, yet (to our knowledge) none hath been urged to ſubſcribe it.</p>

                           <p>To the tenth, we know no ſuch ſeditious Miniſters: and when any Miniſters alleadged ſeditious, ſhall bee called before the Judge ordinar, they ſhall be puniſhed according to juſtice.</p>
                           <p>To the eleventh, wee know none of his Majeſties good Subjects, who are now deterred or threatned, nor do we allow that any ſhould bee troubled, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes then by order of law, and if any feare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there is an ordinar way in juſtice, which they may uſe: And if under the name of good ſubjects, be meaned excommunicat perſons, who by the Laws of this Countrey ſhould bee rebells, and caption uſed againſt them, which hath been deſired by the Kirk and Countrey, and refuſed, and who alſo are the authours of all the evils have come upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, none can give aſſurance for their indemnity, who ſtands thus guilty and odious to the whole people.</p>
                           <p>To the twelfth, it is anſwered in the anſwer to the ſixt.</p>
                           <p>To the thirteenth, the reaſon that the Magiſtrats of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> did not go on in the ſtricteſt way of juſtice in that buſineſſe, was, becauſe the Lord Theſaurer thought that the too ſtrict going on in that matter, might hinder his Majeſties better ſervice. Likeas the Magiſtrates uſed all poſſible diligence to try who were the actours; and having examined diverſe of them, who were alleadged to have been of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they all denyed, and no proof could bee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: One whereof was <hi>the wife at the neather Bow,</hi> and one <hi>Little</hi> a Barbour.</p>

                           <p>To the fourteenth, this is denyed, becauſe to our knowledge no ſuch exception hath been at any of theſe elections.</p>
                           <p>To the fifteenth, there are none who are alleadged to have railed either in ſtreets, or in the Pulpits, who ſhall not bee made anſwerable and lyable to the law, for what they have ſpoken, when they ſhall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed before the judge ordinar.</p>
                           <p>To the ſixteenth, it is denyed.</p>
                           <p>The ſeventeenth, <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> was already cleared, that he was not the cauſe of their ſtay; and thoſe that did ſtop them, did it for the reaſons contained in the paper herewith given in.</p>
                           <p>To the laſt, as we are moſt unwilling to fall upon any queſtion, which may ſeeme to import the leaſt contradiction with his Majeſtie, ſo if it had not been the truſt which wee gave to the relation of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, who did report to us his Majeſties gracious expreſſions related daily to us at <hi>Dunce,</hi> and put in note by many of our number, which were a great deal more ſatisfactorie to us then the written Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the ſame would not have been acceptable, which did call the Aſſembly pretended, our humble and loyall proceedings, diſorders, our courſes diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Monarchicall government: nor the caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> randred (which was onely taken for the ſafetie of the towne of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) ſimply, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſurance by writ, of their indemnitie, except for the truſt we repoſed in their relation, and confidence in his Majeſties royall word, which we beleeve they did not forget, but will bring thoſe who did heare the treatie to a right remembrance thereof, which paper was onely written for that cauſe, leſt either his

But this is one evill amongſt many that preſſeth us ſore through the want of his Majeſties Royall preſence amongſt us, which we truſt will move his Majeſty in his fatherly affection, to be the more tender: and all others, remembring themſelves, to be the more equall in their judgment and actions toward us.</p>

            <p>ONe thing there is very neceſſary to be remembred, before we come to the proceedings of our Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſent from the Parliament to the King: A paper bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome reaſons to prove, <hi>that in commanding to ſwear the Covenant 1580, and 1581. his Majeſty that then was, and his Councell, did not intend the abjuration of Epiſcopacie.</hi> This paper although it be come to few hands before this time, yet was it much eſteemed by the Author, and therefore was put in his Majeſties owne hand, and by his Majeſty ſent to one of our Miniſters, as a ſtrong hold and impregnable ſtrength for Epiſcopacie, againſt all that had been done in the Aſsembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> or was intended in the enſuing Aſſembly and Parliament. It ſeemeth indeed to be the laſt endeavour and aſſay of our adverſaries in that kind, from no ſmall knowledge of the proceedings of this Kirk in former times, and with no leſſe artifice and engine ſet on worke, wherein they will outſtrip all that hath been written in the large Declaration, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on things childiſh and triviall, in compariſon of this fine and ſubtill invention never brought to light before.

                        <p>BEcauſe, but ten yeares before, <hi>viz.</hi> In 71. there was a ſolemne agreement made between the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of his Majeſties Councell, and the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Generall Aſſembly of the Kirk, That (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Kings minoritie, or without a contrary order from Parliament) Arch biſhops and Biſhops, ſhould continue as before they did: And that in every Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politicall and Epiſcopall See, there ſhould be a Deane and a Chapter, and that the bounds of Dioceſes ſhould not be confounded. Nay, there was an exact Forme, at that time ſet down by the ſaid ſeverall Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſtred in the bookes of Councell for the creating of Biſhops after a Proteſtant manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Conge deſlire</hi> to the Deane and Chapter, then a forme of returning the election, with petition to the King for his Royall aſſent, with commandement to the Arch-Biſhop, &amp;c. for conſecration, then the Oath the new Biſhop was to take before his Majeſty, <hi>viz. That he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Kings Majeſtie Supreame Governour of his Realme, as well in things Temporall, as in the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and purgation of Religion</hi> (which differs in wordes from the Engliſh Oath of Supremacie, but is in ſenſe the ſame) <hi>And that he held the ſaid Biſhoprick, and the poſſeſsions thereof under God onely of his Majeſties Crown &amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, there was a forme concluded on, for his reſtitution to his Temporalities.</p>
                        <p>Now this agreement was in preciſe tearmes confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17384:30"/>by his Majeſtie and Councell in that ſelfe ſame yeere 81. when that Covenant was commanded by them to be ſworne by the Subject. So that it cannot be conceived, that his Majeſty and Councell ſhould in the ſame yeere give order to ſweare downe Epiſcopacie, wherein they apparantly took ſuch ſpeciall care to confirme it. And no honeſt man will deny that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was bound to ſweare that Covenant in that ſenſe, and none other, which was agreeable to their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who commanded it to be ſworne.</p>
                        <p>It is objected that under thoſe words (<hi>Wee abjure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Popes wicked Hierarchie</hi>) Epiſcopacie is ſworn downe.</p>
                        <p>R. If by thoſe wordes they will over-throw Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie, I ſee not but withall they muſt be forced to confeſſe, that they have at once abjured both their Presbyters and their Deacons.</p>
                        <p>For the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> makes the Hierarchie of the Church to conſiſt of thoſe three Orders; Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons. Now, if under the word <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> one of theſe be ſworne down, how can the other two eſcape? for it conſiſts alike of three, and therefore all three muſt needes runne the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                        <p>If they reply, that indeed they ſtill retaine <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> but yet ſo onely as they are ordained in the reformed Churches.</p>
                        <p>R. The like I reply for <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that they were then ordained in a forme allowed by reformed Churches, as this in ſubſtance was by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in preciſe tearmes by the Commiſſioners of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For it is not probable, that in ten yeeres ſpace, there ſhould bee no Biſhoprick voyde, and ſo
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17384:31"/>none ordained according to the forme in the Councell Bookes. Nay, it is apparently plaine, that ſome were ſo ordained, and took that fore-named Oath, viz. <hi>John Archbiſhop of Saint Andrewes</hi> in the yeere 72. and <hi>James Biſhop of Dunkell</hi> in the yeere 73. as it is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the books of Councell: where perhaps others are recorded too.</p>
                        <p>If they ſay, That the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Biſhops muſt needes be part of the <hi>Popes Hierarchy,</hi> becauſe they ſucceeded thoſe, and received impoſition of hands from thoſe who lived in obedience to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>R. I againe reply, That their <hi>Presbyters</hi> are in the very ſame caſe: for, I preſume they will not ſay, but they muſt needes derive their orders, either from <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> of that obedience, or from <hi>Presbyters</hi> who were ordained by ſuch <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Becauſe that ſeeing in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation, there were no other Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men in theſe parts, they muſt take their orders ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from them, or none; for I perſwade my ſelf, they will not affirme, That <hi>non Presbyter</hi> can <hi>ordinare Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterum.</hi> Nay as they are learned men, they ſhould not ſay, but that a Prieſt ordained by the new Roman Church, if he leave his ſuperſtition, and turne Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, needes no more ordination to become a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with us.</p>
                        <p>But what then muſt be the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>That they abjure the Popes wicked Hierarchy?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>R. As I conceive, the ſenſe of them is plaine from a precedent clauſe in that Covenant, viz. <hi>(that they abjure the Popes five baſtard Sacraments)</hi> and yet I hope, they intended not to ſweare out either <hi>Matrimony,</hi> or <hi>holy orders</hi> in generall (which yet are two, as all know, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned by that Church amongſt her five) but onely
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17384:31"/>they abjured thoſe corruptions and ſuperſtitious formes which the Romiſh Church had annexed to theſe divine Inſtitutions: as in calling them Proper Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>So when they abjured <hi>his wicked Hierarchy,</hi> they did not ſweare out <hi>Biſhops,</hi> no more then they did <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> or <hi>Deacons:</hi> But they abjured the corruptions and ſuperſtitious Con-comitants, which the <hi>Pope</hi> had annexed to thoſe holy Callings. V.g. amongſt many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſes, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> were conſtrained to ſweare ſuch an obedience and dependence on the <hi>Pope,</hi> as was derogatorie to the ſupreame power of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Prince.</hi> So that then it was almoſt an impoſſible thing to be at once a ſtout <hi>Prelat,</hi> and a loyall ſubject. And ſuppoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> in this treaſonable conſtitution, they were then (no doubt) in that point, the <hi>Popes wicked Hierarchy,</hi> as now they may be the <hi>Conſiſtories.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All this, I the rather urge, becauſe I conceive, that the acts of King and Councell are the beſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that Covenant, becauſe it was ſet on foot by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of King and Councell: for <hi>Quiſ<expan>

                              <hi>THE ANSWER.</hi> Whether in commanding to ſweare the Covenant <hi>1580.</hi> and <hi>81.</hi> his Majeſty that then was, and his Councell, did intend the abjuration of Epiſcopacie,</head>
                           <p>IN all commanded oaths and abjurations, a twofold deception is to be avoided; One is, in him who taketh the Oath, that he have no fraudulent intention, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſound &amp; profeſſed intention of him who ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the Oath; otherwiſe, both Gods Name is taken
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17384:32"/>in vaine, and our Superiour is deluded. The other is, In him that tendereth the Oath, that hee have not an hid and ſecret intention, contrair to that which is open and profeſſed. In this caſe, the regard muſt be had, not to that which is ſecret and unknowne, but to that which is profeſſed, and which is knowne to be the true meaning of the words of the Oath.</p>
                           <p>That abjuration of Epiſcopacie was profeſſedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Covenant 1580. and 1581. by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and his Councell, may be apparant. Firſt, from the words of the Confeſſion commanded to be ſworne; where profeſſion is made, that we ſhall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and diſcipline of this Church, which diſcipline at that time was not the governement of the Church by Biſhops, but by Presbyteries: the whole heads of the policie of the Church, (except ſuch as concerned Patronages, Church rents, and the like) after much agitation from Aſſembly to Aſſembly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed upon, not onely by the Generall Aſſembly, but by his Majeſties Councell, Epiſcopacie being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, and Presbyteriall governement eſtabliſhed: ſuch as before were called Biſhops, being tyed to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular flocks, ordained to be called by their own names and by the name of brethren, and forbidden to uſurp the power of Presbyteries, till at laſt in the Generall Aſſembly holden at <hi>Dundie,</hi> July 1580. the office of a Biſhop was aboliſhed by a particular act, as unlawfull in it ſelf, and Biſhops ordained to dimit the ſamine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of Excommunication: Like as in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> April 1581. the ſaid act was further explained and confirmed: the Kings Commiſſioner preſented to the Aſſembly the Confeſſion of faith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by his Majeſty and his houſhold, together with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17384:32"/>a delineation of the bounds of the Presbyterie to bee erected, with a Letter to that end for the diſſolving of Prelacie, the booke of Policie was inſert in the Regiſter of the Church, and the Confeſſion of faith immediatly thereafter ordained to be ſubſcribed according to his Majeſties Proclamation. As before the forming of the book of diſcipline, and the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of Epiſcopacie; ſo now the ſubſcription of the Confeſſion of faith, and erection of Presbyteries went on together: In July 1580. Epiſcopacie was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. In January following, the Confeſſion of faith was ſubſcribed by the King and his houſhold. In March it was commanded to be ſubſcribed by the ſubjects. And in Aprill direction was given by the Aſſembly for ſubſcription and erection of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The ſame is manifeſt from other words of the Confeſſion, wherein the Popes wicked Hierarchie is abjured. It is confeſſed according to the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> that the Popiſh Hierarchy conſiſteth of theſe three orders: Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons: for neither are the Pope, Primates, Metropolitans, or Archbiſhops, members of the Hierarchy, but as they are Biſhops; neither are the inferiour orders of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, Acoluths, Exorciſts &amp;c. of the Hierarchy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no rule over the people, but onely ſerve the Prieſts and Deacons, which although they be the loweſt order in the Hierarchy, yet are they of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy by reaſon of their charge over the people. Hence is it, that in the Confeſſion of faith, the Popes manifold orders are ſet apart and diſtinguiſhed from the Popes Hierarchy. This being the Popiſh Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchy abjured by us, it muſt be interpreted to bee as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17384:33"/>farre abjured, as by the doctrine and conſtitution of our Kirk, it is interpreted to be Popiſh, that is, as it is made up, and doeth conſiſt of theſe three orders, and therefore the unlawfulneſſe of any one of the orders, maketh the Hierarchy componed of the three, to be unlawfull. It is a paralogiſme to argue from our abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Popiſh Hierarchy, that wee have at once abjured every member thereof: It is enough that any one member is abjured. Secondly, all the three or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are interpreted to be Popiſh, in ſo farre as Biſhops the head of the Hierarchy, not onely had their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Pope, which was an high derogation to the Prince, but alſo becauſe their office was in it ſelfe a corruption, it having no warrant in the word of God, which was a diſhonour done to the Son of God. And the other two of presbyters and Deacons, are thought lawfull and warrantable in themſelves, interpreted to be Popiſh, as having Popiſh corruptions adhering to them their Presbyters being ſacrificing Prieſts &amp;c. and receiving ordination before and without a calling to a particular charge, and their Deacons admitted to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Baptiſme, and having nothing of the office of a Deacon, as it is inſtitute by the Apoſtle, and uſed in the reformed Churches. And therefore the office of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was purged out of this Church, as Popiſh in it ſelf, and the other two which had degenerated, were purged of their Popiſh corruptions and abuſes, and the office retained according to the firſt inſtitution and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive integrity. It is to be obſerved here, that althogh this Hierarchy did enter into the Church before the Pope came to his greatnes, yet it is called the Popes Hierarchy, becauſe it was maintained and obtruded u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Church after the myſtery began to work, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17384:33"/>is, after Popery began, even as dedicating of Churches, Altars, Dayes, Vowes to creatures, &amp;c. are here called the Popes, although all of theſe entred not at one time into the Church.</p>
                           <p>This one ground of trueth furniſheth anſwer to all objections made in the contrair. The rule and paterne of office bearers in the Church, is to bee learned from Scripture, and not from the example of other reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, which wee reverence according as they are conforme to that ſtraight rule and firſt patterne. We doe not abjure Scottiſh Biſhops, becauſe they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Popiſh Biſhops, who lived in obedience to the Pope, and becauſe they received ordination from them: but becauſe although they preſume to be the chief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice bearers in the houſe of God, they have no warrant nor authority from God. And therefore it cannot bee inferred that Presbyters and Deacons ought to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, becauſe they received ordination either from popiſh Biſhops, or from Presbyter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> ordained by ſuch Biſhops: for whatſoever be the conſecration of the one, or ordination of the other, we ſtill account Epiſcopacie to be one of the reliques of poperie, and for that cauſe to be rejected, and the office of Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to be a divine Inſtitution, and therefore to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and being purged, to be retained. Where it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That by like reaſon we might be interpreted to abjure Matrimonie and Orders, becauſe we abjure the Popes five baſtard ſacraments. This objection were ſtrong, if wee could give no better warrant from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for Matrimonie and Ordination of Miniſters, then for Epiſcopacie: but ſince theſe are warranted and not this, the accidentall corruptions of theſe, and the ſubſtance of this ought to be abjured.</p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:17384:34"/>
                           <p n="3">3. The intention of authority is manifeſt by the commanding to ſubſcribe the Confeſſion of faith in the yeare 1590. when we had no Biſhops, and after Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks were annexed to the Crown. It is not to be ſuppoſed that authority had one intention at this time, and a contrary intention in the yeere 1580. The Kings Majeſty that then was, did write and ſubſcribe with his own hand in the margine of a printed Sermon which was preached by <hi>D. Bancroft</hi> at <hi>Pauls</hi> croſſe, theſe words: <hi>My ſpeaking, writing, and actions, were ever one, and without diſſembling or bearing up any thing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ne quid aſperius. IAMES REX.</hi> As the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly had the ſame intention in ſubſcribing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion 1581. at the commandment of authority, which they had in the yeere 1590. when they petitioned the Councell for interpoſing their authority to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: ſo muſt we think, that the King and Councell had the ſame intention at the one time and the other, and that the Councell and Aſſembly had the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention at both times, conforme to this intention of the Councell and Aſſembly, when at any time afterward there was any meaning or motion to bring in Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie again in this Church, the confeſſion of faith was alledged to the contrary, as may be ſeen by diverſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. His Majeſties intention is further knowne (if there be yet any doubt) by the true commentary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in his actions: for after the Aſſemblies had caſt forth Epiſcopacie, and eſtabliſhed presbyteriall governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while they were now about the dividing of the countrey in circuits for presbyteries, the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſent to the Aſſembly conveened at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Aprill 1581. a delineation or plot for this end, and for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17384:34"/>of Prelacies, and with all the frame of a Letter to bee directed to Noblemen and others for promoving the work; for which the Aſſembly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned humble thanks to his Majeſty. All this was done immediatly after the confeſſion of faith was ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by his Majeſty and his houſhold in January, and was commanded to bee ſubſcribed by the Subjects in March, ſo that there can be no queſtion about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and meaning of King, Councell and Aſſembly in the point of the diſcipline of the Church, mentioned in the confeſſion of faith.</p>
                           <p>Yet One thing is mainly objected, to prove that his Majeſtie and his councell did not intend the abjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Epiſcopacie: In the yeere 1571. there was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne agreement between the Commiſſioners of his Majeſties Councell, and the Commiſſioners of the Generall Aſſembly, that during the Kings minoritie, or without a contrary order from Parliament, there ſhould be Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, Deans, Chapters, Abbots, and Priors, their office and forme of election, the oath taken by them at their admiſsion, the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Temporalities were all particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon. This agreement in the yeare 1571, was in preciſe tearmes confirmed by his Majeſty and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in the yeere 1581. when the Covenant was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bee ſworne by the Subject, and therefore it cannot be conceived, that his Majeſty and Councell did in the ſame yeere give order to abjure Epiſcopacie, wherein they took ſuch ſpeciall care to confirme it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> For anſwering this objection, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, firſt, that in the yeere 1571, January 12. there was indeed a convention of Superintendents, Miniſters and other Commiſſioners, for conſulting about the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17384:35"/>of the church; but that convention was not a Generall Aſſembly of the Church: for the Regiſter calls it onely a Convention, and not an Aſſembly: the ordinary Aſſembly was holden at <hi>Saint Andrewes</hi> in the ſame yeere 1571, March 6. according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Generall Aſſembly the yeere before. This convention was procured by the Court for worldly ends, eſpecially that titles of Biſhops, Abbots and Priors, which were not proper in the perſons of Noblemen, might be given to Kirk-men or Miniſters, with ſome ſmall portion of the benefice, that the noble men themſelves might reape the benefite of the Rent, which was the cauſe of the Scottiſh name of <hi>Tulchan</hi> Biſhops at that time, a name not improper for them, a <hi>Tulchan</hi> in our language being the skin of a calfe ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with ſtraw, and ſet up beſide the Kow to make her give milk to the owner. 2.

The articles and concluſions agreed upon by the Commiſſioners of his Majeſties Councell, and that convention were not approven in the next ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Generall Aſſembly holden at <hi>Saint Andrewes</hi> March 6. 1571. the Generall Aſſembly at <hi>Perth</hi> 1572. was not only offended with the names of Archbiſhops, Deanes, Archdeacons, Chancellours, &amp;c. as ſounding to Popery, but alſo declared that they did not approve
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17384:35"/>that order of Church governement, but did tolerat the ſame allanerly, till a more perfect ſhould be obtained, for which they laboured afterward at all occaſions. So that the concluſions of that meeting at <hi>Leith,</hi> 1571. never had the authority of this Church, but were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by it. During the time of this toleration, many complaints were made in the Aſſemblies againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: and in the yeere 1573. and afterward ſome were appointed by the Aſſemblies to conferre with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Lords of ſecret Councell, upon the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and policie to bee continued and eſtabliſhed in the Church, till at laſt after many diſputations and much reaſoning, the matter was brought to a finall concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the office of Biſhops was aboliſhed, and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall governement eſtabliſhed.</p>
                           <p>Next concerning the act of Councell in the yeere 1580. confirming the agreement at <hi>Leith,</hi> we anſwere,
<list>
                                 <item>1. That the Councell lawfully could not confirme that agreement, introduce Epiſcopacie, or change the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement of the Kirk, contrary to the acts of ſo many Generall Aſſemblies keeped from the yeere 1571, to 1580. wherein the policie and governement of the Church was ſo expreſſely ſet downe.</item>
                                 <item>2. The act of Councell was never publiſhed nor made known to the ſubject, nor heard of in this cauſe, till this time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no other thing can be alledged for ſalving of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie from abjuration.</item>
                                 <item>3. This act of Councell was poſterior to the command for ſubſcribing the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith: for the act was made in October 1581. and the commandement came forth in March, many moneths before.</item>
                                 <item>4. No ſuch intention was profeſſed when the charge was given for ſubſcription, neither could the confeſſion of faith in any ſenſe beare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17384:36"/>of that agreement: theſe offices, and the forme of their election being damned as Popiſh in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly before; no man will marvell much at ſuch an act of Councell, who knoweth what other acts paſſed that yeere in Councell, and who is not a ſtranger in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of that time, the peruſall and knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will both ſhew how ſuddenly Covenants have been broken, and will eaſily give ſatisfaction againſt all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this kind, to ſo many as deſire to know the trueth.</item>

            <p>AGainſt this our abjuration of Epiſcopacie, firſt and laſt, our adverſaries ariſe with great hate &amp; ſtrength and fight with tooth and naile: for upon the one hand,<hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacie </hi>muſt be aſſerted by no other then by divine right, and<hi> Hierarchie </hi>maintained not only as tollerable and lawfull, but as neceſſary and divine; Although before this time, neither our own Doctors and Prelats, nor the Engliſh have been ſo peremptory &amp; bold about this point; for while ſome of them have maintained Epiſcopacie by divine authority, yet others have been more ingenuous confeſsing it only to be grounded upon ancient cuſtome, and therefore to be an humane invention, or Eccleſiaſtick tradition. And a third ſort different from both, will have it to be Apoſtolick. Again ſome of them make the forme of Kirk government to be univerſall and perpetuall, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hold it to be locall, and conformable to the civill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; Thus have they been divided one of them from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; But in this exigence and point of time, one muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for all to cry up Epiſcopacie, as coming from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp; not from the earth, even<hi> as it hath the altitude of fixed ſuperiority, &amp; the latitude of ſpirituall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. </hi>And why? becauſe we have abjured it, and our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17384:36"/>have found it unlawfull<hi> in this Kirk: </hi>this was their modeſty of expreſsion, deſiring more to reforme at home, then to be buſie abroad, for which they find no more cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, nor leſſe acerbity of ſpirit, then if they had given out a generall ſentence concerning the government of the Kirk. It is not for us, nor for this naked relation of Truth to enter in diſpute, but if our adverſaries ſhow not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more learned in their arguments, nor they prove skilled in our Kirk-government and Hiſtory, which are the grounds of their vehement exhortation to their Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern brethren, they will be found to have given but words in ſtead of ſubſtance. As our adverſaries have riſen thus upon the one hand againſt our abjuration of Epiſcopacy, by averring it to be of divine authority, that the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the point of Kirk-government may be plain and ſtrong: So do they upon the other hand with all immanity and bar barouſneſse againſt all our treaties and intreaties, conſtrain our poore Countreymen and women in<hi> England </hi>and<hi> Ireland, </hi>to ſweare oaths, whereof ſome covertly, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſely carry an abjuration of the Oath and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of<hi> Scotland, as damnable and treaſonable, </hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was ſworne at firſt by the King himſelf that then was, and is now again ſubſcribed by his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioner in his name, and with his conſent ordained to be ſubſcribed by Subjects of all ranks throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and therefore may as well he called a<hi> Royall </hi>as a<hi> Popular </hi>Covenant: What impiety this is againſt God, and what provocation of his Juſtice, what a ſnare it is to many poore ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how great diſhonour is hereby done to Royall authority by had counſellours and wicked mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and how farre it is from procuring cheerfull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or tying the hearts of people to Soveraignitie, wee leave to be conſidered, and heartily wiſh that a more wiſe,

                        <p>SIR, as wee did ſhow in that humble Remonſtrance which wee gave your Majeſtie in writ; That no earthly thing could bee more grievous to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects, conveened by your Royall Authoritie, in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then that their loyaltie ſhould be called in queſtion, or that any ſuch hard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſhould be given againſt their proceedings, as might derogate from that high eſtimation which they have of Soveraignitie, and the tender reſpect they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your Majeſties inviolable authoritie. So doe wee now acknowledge your Majeſties goodnes and juſtice in keeping one eare for us againſt all ſuggeſtions and obloquies, till the reaſons of our proceedings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17384:40"/>were made knowne from our ſelves, and that your Majeſtie is graciouſly pleaſed to grant us this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a full and publick hearing. But becauſe the Parliament of that your Majeſties ancient and native Kingdome is independent, and not comptable to any other Judicatorie: Wee hope your Majeſtie will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and allow us to declyne to ſpeake or anſwere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of your Majeſties Councells, or other Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories whatſoever, as theſe who have any power to judge of the Lawes, actions, or proceedings of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of that Kingdome: As wee acknowledge your Majeſties favour in allowing us to tender the liberties and freedome of your Majeſties ancient and native Kingdome: So are wee glad before all the world, to cleare the loyaltie, and lawfulnes of their proceedings, and doe congratulate, that your Majeſtie hath indicted a Parliament heere, who wee hope will advert to the good of Religion, your Majeſties honour, and peace of your Dominions, albeit they be not Judges to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of our actions, which when they ſhall be knowne to your Majeſtie, not upon report, but upon true tryall, wee are moſt confident, will merit approbation at the Throne of your Majeſties Juſtice. But becauſe wee heare that your Majeſties good Subjects are traduced as having intention to diminiſh your Majeſties autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and ſhake off that civill and duetifull obedience due to Soveraignitie.</p>
                        <p>Therefore before we deſcend to the particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and articles of the Parliament, for vindicating us from ſo grievous and foull an imputation, wee doe in our own name, and in name of the Parliament who ſent us, Declare before GOD and the world, that we never had, nor have any thought of with-drawing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17384:40"/>our ſelves from that humble and duetifull ſubjection and obedience to your Majeſtie, and your government, which by the deſcent and raigne of ſo many Kings is due to your Majeſtie: And never had nor have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or deſire to attempt any thing that may tend to the diminution of your Majeſties Princely power. But on the contrare, acknowledge our quietnes, ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and happines, to depend upon the ſafetie of your Majeſties Perſon, and maintenance of your greatnes and Royall authoritie, as Gods Vicegerent ſet over us for maintenance of Religion, and adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: And have ſolemnely ſworne not onely to ſtand to the defence of your Majeſties Perſon and authoritie, in the preſervation and defence of Religion, Liberties, and Lawes of the Church and Kingdome; But alſo in every cauſe which may concerne your Majeſties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhall according to the Lawes of the Kingdome, and the duetie of good Subjects, concurre with our friends and followers in quiet manner, or in Armes as wee ſhall be required. But if any be ſo wicked as to ſeeke occaſions to divide betwixt your Majeſtie and your Kingdome, and for their owne ends goe about to proſtitute the puritie of Religion, and the Liberties and Lawes of that your Majeſties ancient and native King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Wee can give them no other Character, but that which your Majeſties Father of bleſſed memorie gave them, terming ſuch men, <hi>vipers and pests againſt the King and his Kingdome.</hi> And if it pleaſe God, for our ſinnes, to make our condition that deplorable, as they may get the ſhadow of your Majeſties authority, (as wee hope in God they will not) to palliate their ends; Then as theſe, who are ſworne to defend our Religion, our recourſe muſt be onely to the GOD of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17384:41"/>
                           <hi>Jacob</hi> for our refuge, who is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, and by whom Kings doe reigne, and Princes decree Juſtice. And if in ſpeaking thus, out of zeale to Religion, and the dutie we owe to our Countrey, and that charge which is laid upon us, any thing hath eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped us, ſith it is ſpoken from the ſinceritie of our hearts, wee fall down at your Majeſties feet, humbly craving pardon for our freedome.</p>
                        <p>Having thus with your Majeſties permiſſion clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the loyaltie of your Subjects. That wee may next ſhew the reaſon of their demands, and equitie of their proceedings in Parliament: We doe firſt crave, that if our anſwers cannot give plenarie ſatisfaction to the objections and exceptions, that ſhall bee made againſt their proceedings; That our not knowing of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections (albeit wee did often require your Majeſties Commiſſioner to ſhew the ſame, that we might be the more able to give your Majeſtie content) yet being ſtill concealed from us, and the Records and Regiſters of Parliament being kept up from us, may ſerve much for our excuſe; and if any of the propoſitions, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſought or craved in Parliament, ſhall ſeem harſh at the firſt view, to theſe who know not our laws: That we do expect from them the judgment of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who ought rather, nor paſſe raſh cenſure on us, to profeſſe <hi>ignorantiam &amp; juris &amp; facti alieni;</hi> and that they would diſtinguiſh betwixt the deſires, and actions of a Parliament, who being conveened by royal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and honoured with your Majeſty, or your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners preſence, are makers of Laws, and againſt whom there is no law, and the actions of privat perſons, againſt whom laws are made.</p>
                        <p>And as the deſires of the Subjects are no other in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17384:41"/>matter, but what they did humbly crave in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer petitions, and are neceſſar for eſtabliſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the good and peace of the Kingdome, which can never repugne to the Kings honour, and are agreeable to the articles of pacification; ſo in manner they are agreeable to the Lawes and practiſes of that Kingdome. And to condiſcend more ſpecially, all the articles given in, are either ſuch as concern privat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſuch as are for <hi>manufactories, trade of Merchants,</hi> &amp; others of that kind, which doe not ſo much concern your Majeſtie or the publick, as the intereſt of privat men which are but <hi>minima, &amp; de minimis non curat lex:</hi> Or they are publick acts, which do concerne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and liberties of the Kirk and Kingdome, as <hi>the ratifying the concluſions of the Aſſembly, the act of constitution of Parliament, the act of reſciſsion, the act againſt poperie,</hi> and others of that kinde, wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Parliament knew that the eyes of the world were upon them; that hard conſtructions have beene made of their proceedings, and that malice is promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for her obloquies, and waiteth on with open mouth to ſnatch at the ſmalleſt ſhadow of diſreſpect to your Majeſtie: That our proceedings may bee made odious to ſuch as know them not, wee have endeavoured to walk with that tenderneſſe which becometh duetifull Subjects, who are deſirous to limite themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reaſon, and the rule of Law: For better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof, we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>regnum conſtituendum,</hi> and <hi>regnum constitutum;</hi> a Kingdome before it be ſettled, and a Kingdome which is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Laws; wherein as good ſubjects eſteeme it their greateſt glorie to maintaine the honour, and lawfull authoritie of their King; ſo good Kings (as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17384:42"/>father of ever bleſſed memorie affirmes) hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that maxime, That <hi>ſalus populi eſt ſupremalex,</hi> will be content to governe their Subjects, according to the Law of God, and fundamentall laws of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Next we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the Kirk and State, betwixt the Eccleſiaſtick, and civil power, both which are materially one; yet formallie they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct in power, in juriſdiction, in laws, in bodies, in ends, in offices, and officers; and albeit the Kirk and Eccleſiaſtick Aſſemblies thereof, bee formally diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and contradiſtinct from the Parliament and civill Judicatories, yet there is ſo ſtrict and neceſſary a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction betwixt the Eccleſiaſtick, and civill juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, betwixt Religion and Juſtice: as the one cannot firmely ſubſiſt, and bee preſerved without the other; And therefore like <hi>Hypocrites</hi> twinnes, they muſt ſtand and fall, live and die together, which made us in all our petitions to your Majeſtie, who is <hi>cuſtos utriuſque ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae,</hi> to crave that as matters Eccleſiaſtick may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, by the generall and other Aſſemblies of the Kirk, and matters civill by Parliament: So ſpecially to crave, that the ſanction of civill law, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Eccleſiaſtick concluſions, and conſtitutions of the Kirk and her Aſſemblies, leſt there ſhould be any repugnance betwixt the Eccleſiaſtick and Civill laws: which your Majeſtie did graciouſly condeſcend unto. And your Majeſties Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repreſenting your Majeſties royall perſon and power in the generall Aſſembly, wherein all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Pariſhes of <hi>Scotland</hi> are repreſented, after particular inquirie anent the true and reall cauſes of the evils, which do ſo much trouble the peace of that Kirk and Kingdome. Having found that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17384:42"/>government of the Kirk by Biſhops, and Civil places and power of Kirk-men, amongſt other novations brought in that Kirk, were two main cauſes of theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: And having conſented, that Epiſcopacie bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the Kirk be removed off the ſtate; And declared all civill places and power of Kirk-men, to be unlawfull in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And having ratified the Covenant, ordaining all the Subjects to ſubſcribe the ſame with the generall Aſſemblies explanation, in that ſenſe: and being oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ratifie the concluſions of the Aſſembly in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: It doth neceſſarly follow, that Biſhops who uſurped to be the Kirk, and did in name of the Kirk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the third eſtate; and Abbots, Priors, and all others who did repreſent the Kirk to bee taken away, which alſo by neceſſar conſequence doth infer, that there bee an act of conſtitution of the Parliament without them, and an act for repealing the former laws, whereby the Kirk was declared the third eſtate, and Biſhops did repreſent the Kirk, both which the Kirk hath now renounced and condemned: So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the act of conſtitution of the Parliament, and act reſciſſorie paſſe, it is impoſsible either to have a valide Parliament, or to ratifie the concluſions of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie: which your Majeſtie hath graciouſly condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to performe, and which your Subjects are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged to maintain: neither doth the paſſing of theſe acts wrong the Kirk nor State, nor diminiſh your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties princely power, and royall authoritie; not the Kirk, becauſe ſhe hath renunced and condemned that civill power and worldly pompe conferred upon her in time of Poperie, eſteeming the ſame not to bee a priviledge, but a detriment incompatible with her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17384:43"/>nature, and as being repugnant to the doctrine, and diſcipline of that Kirk, <hi>&amp; volenti non fit injuria;</hi> nor is the State wronged, becauſe the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of that Kingdome, being repreſented by their Commiſſioners from Presbitries in the generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, hath given their conſent to the deſires and concluſions of the Kirk, have with allowance of your Majeſties Commiſſioner, according to the ordinance of the generall Aſſembly, and Councel, ſworne and ſubſcribed the Confeſſion of Faith, in that ſenſe; and have alwayes been, and are your Majeſties ſupplicants, That the Parliament may ratifie what the Aſſembly hath found, and concluded: Neither can wee beleeve that your Majeſtie (who we hear doth acknowledge Princes to be like ſhining ſtars, which have their ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor for the benefit of the world, and who eſteemes the proſperitie, and welfare of your people, your greateſt content, and the having of their hearts to bee your Majeſties greateſt ſecurity, which are the words of <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17384:43"/>doth juſtly belong to the King, before any Biſhops were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which did belong to him in time of Poperie, when Biſhops were allowed, and had their dependance of the Pope, and which did likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the King, in the time of reformation, when E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacie was abjured and removed out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> In the which oath, all the Subjects are ſworne to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your Majeſties greatneſſe, and authoritie, with their lives and means: which wee ſhall acknowledge, and will be ready to defend, to the laſt drop of our bloud.</p>
                        <p>And ſeeing your Majeſties Subjects have no other ends, but ſuch as ſerve for eſtabliſhing of Religion, and the peace of the Kingdome, and are agreeable to the fundamental Laws thereof, and to the articles of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; And that the Parliament is the onely lawfull mean to remeid our evils, remove diſtractions, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a ſolide and perfect peace. The ſum of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſubjects their deſire is, that your Majeſtie may bee graciouſly pleaſed, to command, that the Parliament may proceed freely, and determine anent all theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles given in to them, and whatever exceptions, obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or informations, are made againſt any of the particular overtures, articles, or proceedings of the Parliament, wee are moſt willing and deſirous, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Majeſties commandement (for avoyding conteſtation about words) to receive the ſame in writ, and are content in the ſame way to returne our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and humble Deſires.</p>

The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that dayes hearing was, that againſt the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> they ſhould ſhow his Majeſty their Inſtructions. And after his Majeſties returne upon the 8. of March, they were commanded to be at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> the next day thereafter, at two of the clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, where ſo ſoon as they did appeare before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, He did call for their Inſtructions, which they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit and read: Their power was called in queſtion, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely ſubſcribed by ſome Noblemen, and Gentlemen, and as not flowing from the Parliament, whereunto they did anſwer; That their Inſtructions were warranted by the Parliament, becauſe they are relative to former Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, given to the Earle of <hi>Dumfermeling,</hi> and Lord <hi>Lowdoun,</hi> which were ſubſcryved by a great many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Gentlemen, and Burgeſſes who were preſent, ſitting in Parliament, and that their laſt Inſtructions are ſubſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by theſe Commiſsioners, who were appointed by the Parliament to make remonſtrances to his Majeſty, and receive the returne of his anſwers, who were authorized with Commiſsion from the Parlîament, to that effect: All which our Commiſsioners did inſtruct. And after long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating anent the validity of their power. The particular diſpute, and reaſonings whereof, our Commiſsioners did for their memory put in writ.

And if there were any obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the contrair, they were ready to receive, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſame in writ. The King ſaid, It was his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17384:44"/>behoved to give theſe, and that his Majeſty was to maintain his actions. And thurſday the 12. of March was aſsigned for their next hearing, and the Kings Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner commanded to give his objections to them in writ, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that time.</p>

               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the 16. of March when our Commiſsioners did appeare before his Majeſty, They did preſent their anſwers in writ, to the former queree and propoſitions, in manner following: viz:</p>

                        <p>AS our power and inſtructions from the Parliament, doe warrant us to ſhow, that their proceedings and deſires, are agreeable to the Lawes and practiſe of the Kingdome, and to the articles of pacification: So we are enjoyned particularly to anſwer all objections, which either were proponed, or which they conceived could be proponed againſt the acts and proceedings of the Parliament: And as concerning any other queſtion which was not moved in Parliament, nor is againſt the articles and propoſitions given in to them; As the ſame did not fall within the conſideration of the Parliament: So neither can it come within the compaſſe of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as that whereunto wee have warrant to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: It is alſo to bee underſtood, that the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and acts given in to the articles, are not ſtatutes, but are onely proponed and given in to them to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Parliament, That the Parliament may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act or refuſe the ſame, as they ſhall find them expedient or inexpedient for the good of the Church and State: And as concerning the queree, anent the prorogation of the Parliament, we are warranted by our inſtructions and informations, to ſhow, that the prorogation of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of that Kingdome, once being conveened in plaine Parliament, and having choſen articles, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on actions; hath ever been done with conſent of the three Eſtates, as may be ſeene in the reigne of <hi>King James</hi> 6. <hi>Queen Mary, K. Ja.</hi> 5. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 4. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 3. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 2. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 1. And ſo forth in all the printed and written Records of Parliament. And they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17384:46"/>that your Majeſtie will be graciouſly pleaſed, to keep that order and forme of prorogation of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which all your moſt worthie and Royall Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours did. Neither did the Parliament expect, that your Majeſtie (who did graciouſly grant this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for eſtabliſhing of Religion, ratifying the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Aſſemblie, and ſettling the peace of the Kingdome; and hath accordingly given an ample power, under your Majeſties broad Seale <hi>pro tentione &amp; obſervatione Parliamenti,</hi> without any power or clauſe of prorogation or delay) would require this Parliament to be prorogued without conſent of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Parliament; Till theſe things be performed which your Majeſtie was graciouſly pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend unto.</p>
                        <p>Where it may be objected, That a Parliament was prorogued or continued, <hi>De mandato Regis:</hi> It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That proves the denomination of the act to be taken from the King; But doth nowayes prove, that the act was made without conſent of the Eſtates, more then that act of Parliament of <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 2. holden at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> the 28. of June 1450. <hi>fol.</hi> 33. Bearing that the three Eſtates did continue the Parliament, without naming the King; will inferre, that the Eſtates wanted the Kings conſent; For it is uſuall that the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of acts of Parliament, is taken, ſometimes from the King onely, ſometimes from the Eſtates, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from both; And that the prorogation was done by act of Parliament, is enough to prove it to be done with conſent of the Eſtates: And the Letter written by <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 6. in the Parliament May 1604. To the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> his Majeſties Secretary; That ſeeing the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was continued, therefore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17384:46"/>the Eſtates ſhould continue the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (which they did) doth evince that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were continued with conſent of the Eſtates. And having thus, (according to the inſtructions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us) ſhowne the Judgement of the Parliament, (whoſe Language and mind wee ought now to ſpeak, and not our own privat opinions) anent the forme and order of prorogation, which hath been conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in all preceeding Parliaments, we doe ſo much tender your Majeſties royall power and lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie (which we have ſolemnely ſworne never to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh) as wee neither dare nor will preſume to exceed our inſtructions, to define what your Majeſtie may doe in the hight of your power. For to diſpute <hi>à poſſe ad eſſe,</hi> is both againſt Law and Divinity; And what ever your Majeſtie may doe in the hight of your power, we hope your Majeſtie will ever bee graciouſly pleaſed to rule your Subjects according to Law, the continuall practice whereof we have ſhowne in this point, neither know we any former Law or practice to the contrair: And if any man hath informed your Majeſty, or affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that it is otherwayes, <hi>affirmanti incumbit probatio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As concerning that act whereby it is craved, <hi>that the power of the articles may bee defined,</hi> wee have directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and information from the Parliament, to ſhow the equity, lawfulneſſe, and expediencie of that act, which may eaſily bee perceived, from the reaſons contained in the narrative of the act it ſelfe, which <hi>brevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis cauſâ,</hi> is referred thereto, as alſo from the written records, and printed acts of Parliament, from the nature of all Committees, and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate and condition of the Parliament of that Kingdome: For as it is cleare by the hiſtorie of that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17384:47"/>Kingdome, and the records of Parliament, that there was never ſuch a thing heard of, as Lords of articles, untill the time of <hi>King David Bruce;</hi> So it is manifeſt in all the printed and written records of Parliament, ſince that time, that many Parliaments had no Lords delegat for articles at all, and when there was any choſen, the nomination and election of them, was ever with the common conſent and advice of the whole Parliament, till the Parliament in <hi>anno</hi> 1617. That the Biſhops took upon them to remove out of plaine Parliament, to the Inner-houſe, and choyſed ſome out of the Noblemen, &amp; the Noblemen them, and they two choyſed the Commiſſioners to be on articles of Shires and Burroughs, which as it was againſt the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; form of election of al preceeding articles, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by &amp; with the prelats: So do it fall &amp; ought to be removed with them, <hi>ut effectus removetur cum fua cauſa:</hi> for they being removed, cannot choiſe the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be on articles, as the Noblemen cannot choſe them, nor can they both together choyſe the Barons &amp; Burgeſſes: So that it doth of neceſſity follow, that there bee no articles, but that all bee done in face of plaine Parliament, as it was of old, or elſe (if articles be) that the ordour of election be from the whole Parliament: or that every Eſtate of Parliament, make choiſe of ſuch of their owne number, as are to bee on articles: For according to the common received <hi>maxime, Quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbari debet; &amp; ſtatus ac ordines regni,</hi> (who are choſen to repreſent the whole Kingdom, and are appointed to conveen in their name, for eſtabliſhing ſuch Lawes as are neceſſare for the good of the Common-wealth) ought to diſcharge that truſt themſelves, and not to intruſt <hi>poteſtatem vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17384:47"/>commiſſam</hi> to ſome few delegat perſons, exceptone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in caſes of neceſſitie and utilitie, which either may be done or omitted, according to conveniencie and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of affaires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as this freedome of choſing or not choſing of articles, in practiſe and <hi>de facto,</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarie and changeable <hi>pro occaſione &amp; distinctione temporum.</hi> So there is never any ſtatutorie law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the neceſſitie of articles, or determining the power and manner of their proceeding, <hi>&amp; in actibus liberis</hi> (of the Law) <hi>non currit preſcriptio:</hi> And it is very agreeable with reaſon, that the power of articles (which is but a committee delegate from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prepare matters for their conſideration) have not a boundleſſe and illimited power, but bee compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them; and the power of articles is onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, and no wayes determinative, and is but <hi>cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> by vertue of a delegation, which ends at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demand of the granter, and ought no wayes to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative of the Parliaments power, but only cumulative; and they ought before cloſing or ryding of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to render an accompt to them of all that hath been proponed or paſt in articles, That the whole Parliament may have a competent time for conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, agitation, mutuall communication, diſcuſſion, and deliberation of the reaſons and concluſions of theſe articles, which are to be voiced; and not to vote blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without foreknowledge, to agree or diſagree, to ſuch things as by their ſuffrages are enacted to bee laws, which requires not onely voycing, but alſo hearing, free reaſoning, and ripe adviſement; as is clear by the commiſſions granted by the Shyres and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs to their Commiſſioners, and from the acts of Parliament, <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 7. <hi>act</hi> 101. And acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17384:48"/>1584. <hi>and</hi> 1587. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>As for anſwer to the <hi>new augmentation of cuſtomes and book of rates.</hi> It is humbly acknowledged, that the cuſtomes belongeth to your Majeſtie, as a part of the patrimonie due to your Crowne: likeas by diverſe acts of Parliament, eſpecially by the 179. <hi>act Par.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 206. <hi>act Par.</hi> 14. <hi>and act</hi> 251 <hi>&amp;</hi> 254. <hi>Par.</hi> 15. K. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. It is evident that the cuſtomes of native and forraigne commodities hath beene impoſed with conſent of the Eſtates; and this new augmentation was onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Excheckquer, and condiſcended unto by ſome of the Burrows, upon promiſe (as is affirmed by them) made by the Earle of <hi>Traquair</hi> your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Theſaurer, That the preſent book of rates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration ſhould be ratified in the next Parliament: the performance whereof was onely craved, by that article given in, And that no new augmentation ſhould be impoſed upon cuſtome, but that which is agreeable to juſtice and the Laws of the Kingdome: Which the burrows conceived, they might verie lawfully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your Majeſtie, and the Parliaments conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon and occaſion of that article given in to your Majeſtie and the Parliament, <hi>anent the value of money, and concerning copper-money,</hi> doth flow from the ſenſible loſſe and great prejudice, which your Majeſties Subjects of that Kingdome doth ſuſtain by the huge quantity of copper money, which hath been coyned there, and allowed with advice of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Councel to paſſe currant, at a rate ſo far above the intrinſique value thereof: as beſide what is coyned within the Kingdome, there are likewiſe a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie coyned abroad in other Countreys, and brought
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17384:48"/>in to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a great quantity of falſe ones forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tinkers, and through occaſion thereof all other money is exported and taken away, and no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney almoſt left, and the crying of them up and down in ſo ſhort ſpace, (of late) hath brought the eſteeme and value of them to ſuch an uncertainty and confuſion, as no man knows now at what rate they ſhould paſſe, or whether they ſhould paſſe or not, which to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Subjects is a very great prejudice; eſpecially to Tradeſmen, and other poore people, in whoſe hands, moſt part of that baſe money is, whoſe diſtreſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cryes to your Majeſtie for remeid. Likeas the importing of Dollars from forraigne kingdomes, and tollerating of them to paſſe (for a long time) at a higher rate and price nor is anſwerable to the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and above that price, gave occaſion to export and take away your Majeſties own coyne; and the crying down of the Dollars thereafter by your Majeſties Councell, at ſuch a time, when as there was little or no other money in <hi>Scotland,</hi> occaſioned great ſcarcitie of money in that Kingdome. From the by-paſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of which loſſe, and for remeid thereof, that arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle craving, that the value of money ſhould not bee altered without advice of the Eſtates of Parliament, was given in without thought or intention to trinch in any ſort upon your Majeſties royal authority; but that your Majeſtie for the good of your Subjects, may bee graciouſly pleaſed, That the ſtandart of the money, conſiſting in the fynnes, the weight, &amp; price of money, which from time to time hath been ruled, and ſet down in Parliament, be not altered, but by advice of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And that the fynnes, price, and weight of money hath been ruled and determined by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17384:49"/>may bee ſeen by that act of Parliament, holden by King <hi>David</hi> the ſecond, in <hi>anno</hi> 1366, in theſe words, <hi>Statutum quod fabricetur moneta de materia jam all at a in regnum, &amp; quod in pondere &amp; metallo aequipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leat monetae currenti in Anglia, &amp; fiat in ipſa ſignum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table per quod poſsit ab omni aliaprius fabricata eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cognoſci, quouſque in proximo Parliamento ſuper hoc maturius aviſari poſsit.</hi> The ſame is alſo manifeſt from a great many other acts in the reignes of <hi>K.

And in the Parliament <hi>an.</hi> 1633, holden by your Majeſties ſelf: There is commiſſion given in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to the ſecret Councel, and other Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, anent the frequent courſe of Dollars, and baſe copper money; by reading of which acts. It is moſt manifeſt, That the fynneſſe, weight, and price of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney hath been ruled and determined by your Majeſties predeceſſours, and your Majeſties ſelf, with advice of Parliament: neither is it meaned, nor intended, that your Majeſties royall priviledge, (which hath beene and is due to your Majeſtie, and your royall anteceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours) ſhall thereby in any fort be trinched upon nor impared.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:17384:49"/>
                        <p>The reaſon of that article, whereby it is humbly craved, that the caſtles of <hi>Edinburgh, Dumbartan,</hi> and <hi>Striviling,</hi> may be intruſted onely to Natives; and theſe to be choſen by advice of Parliament, of ſuch faithfull and honeſt men, as do tender your Majeſties honour, and the ſafetie of the Kingdome: may be ſeene not onely from the nature and importance of the charge, but likewiſe from the former practiſe of your Majeſties royall predeceſſours, who did diſpoſe of theſe caſtles, with the ſpeciall advice and counſell of their Parliament, as is recorded in the old Regiſters of the Parliament 1368. Likeas <hi>fol.</hi> 83. <hi>of the old acts K. Ja.</hi> 4. It is concluded by advice and deliverance of the three Eſtates, That <hi>Patrick</hi> Lord <hi>Haills</hi> be keeper of the caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and artilerie of the ſame, &amp;c. <hi>Item fol.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. <hi>K.

Likeas by diverſe unprinted acts, as in <hi>anno</hi> 1578. and 1585. and 1606. Your Majeſties houſes hath beene diſpoſed of with advice of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And not onely nationall ſtatutes, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of nature and Nations, do forbid the receiving of ſtrangers, to bee keepers of the ſtrengths of a free Kingdome. And when the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> 1604. gave commiſſion anent the Union with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with exception of reſerving of free Monarchie, and the fundamentall laws, liberties, and priviledges of that Kingdome: Your Majeſties father in his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpeech to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> 1607, when he interprets that clauſe of fundamental laws, declares that hee could not make <hi>Scotland</hi> a naked Province without libertie, and ſet Gariſons over it, as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:17384:50"/>do over <hi>Cicilie</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> or govern them by Commiſſioners: So that his Majeſtie in his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation doth acknowledge, that the putting in of Gariſons, eſpecially of ſtrangers, as of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men in the Forts and Caſtles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> puts in <hi>Cicilie</hi> and <hi>Naples;</hi> or as the King of <hi>England</hi> puts <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Forts of <hi>Ireland;</hi> is a breaking of the fundamentall laws and liberties of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the uſing of it like a naked conqueſt Province, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cicilie, Naples,</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> And as your Majeſties Subjects gave an undoubted proofe, how tender their mindes are in the point of obedience to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties commandements, not onely in delivering of the Caſtles to be diſpoſed of, at your Majeſties pleaſure, without any aſſurance, other then their confidence in your Majeſties goodneſſe and juſtice; ſo have they of late given a verie ſubmiſſe and rare teſtimonie of their obedience, in the humble reception of theſe ſtrangers, and ammunition, which your Majeſtie was pleaſed to ſend to the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the honours of the Crown and Kingdome, and regiſters are keept: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their obedience to your Majeſties co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment, to their own ſafety, even at this time, when their ears are filled with rumors of hoſtill preparation againſt them: All which makes them, and us in their names, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſupplicat and expect, that your Majeſtie will bee graciouſly pleaſed by recalling of that Gariſon, to free your loyall ſubjects of theſe feares and dangers, who will ever be ready to hazard their lives and fortunes to do your Majeſtie ſervice. Neither doe they in the act, which is given in to the articles, arrogat or aſſume power, by themſelves to appoint keepers for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Caſtles; but do humbly crave, that your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17384:50"/>may out of your goodneſſe, be graciouſly pleaſed to declare, for further ſatisfaction of your Subjects, that the Captains and Commanders of your Majeſties Caſtles, may bee choſen by advice of the Eſtates of Parliament: And that ſuch as ſhall happen to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced betwixt Parliaments, may beetryed and found by your Majeſties Councell, to be men of ſuch qualitie, as are fit and able to undergo that charge, which in the judgement of the Parliament, derogats nothing from your Majeſties royall power.</p>
                        <p>As for reaſons of the act, <hi>anent the judicatorie of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> we have ſet down ſome few of the many reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which do ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly prove the equity, &amp; juſtnes therof.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The Seſſion and Exchecquer are diſtinct judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and not ſubordinat one to another, and cannot be coincident in the ſame object: And therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the queſtion of right and nullitie of rights, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to be decyded by the Lords of Seſſion, by way of action, or exception; it is altogether incompetent to be diſcuſſed by the Lords of Exchecquer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The Lords of Exchecquer are incompetent judges in a declaratour of nullitie, by way of action, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot annull any right by way of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is a more ſummar way: And it were abſurd in law, ſeeing the ſubject and queſtion is one, whether proponed by way of exception or action, that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges of the action, they ſhould have a more abſolute and ſummar juriſdiction by way of exception.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 It appears by an act of Parliament not printed, 1593, (intituled, <hi>Commiſsion to the Exchecquer anent decyding ſuſpenſions in the Kings cauſe</hi>) that before the ſaid act, the Exchecquer had not power to decyde in ſuſpenſions, while it was given them by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17384:51"/>farre leſſe then can it be thought, that they ever had, or can have power to decyde in the point of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rights: Neither doth the late act 1633, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the Exchecquer to decyde therein expreſly: And if it bee truely conſidered, ſome generall words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, intermixt with the particular caſes therein expreſt, ſhould not, nor cannot be extended to ſo high a point, as the diſputing and decyding of the Subjects, their heretable rights. Likeas at the making of the ſaid late act, the Lords of Seſſion having heard ſome ſurmize, that your Majeſties Advocat was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſuch an act; ſeven or eight of them conveened together, and ſent for the Advocat, who aſſured them, that there was not, nor ſhould not bee any ſuch thing: but that the act ſhould be conceived in ſo clear terms, that it ſhould not be poſſible to draw in under any part thereof, a power to the Lords of Exchecquer to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, let be to decyde in heretable rights. And as the Subjects heretable rights and infeftments are by this act ſaved from being decyded, or annulled by incompetent judges; ſo your Majeſtie is no wayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged thereby, ſeeing the Lords of Seſſion, who by the laws of that Kingdome are proper and competent judges of heretable rights and infeftments; may and will decyde any queſtions, which may concerne your Majeſtie, the nature, tenor, and validitie, of any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table right.</p>

And albeit it may eaſily bee demonſtrat from the prejudice which your Majeſties ancient and native Kingdome ſuſteines, through want of your royall and perſonall preſence, and their living at ſo farre a diſtance from the place of your Majeſties reſidence, how requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite it is, that there bee frequent Parliaments holden in that Kingdome: yet leſt the deſires of your Majeſties ſubjects, might ſeeme in any wayes to trench upon your authoritie, they did paſſe from that part of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and did onely inſiſt, that there might bee a right conſtitution of the Parliament,; and that an act might be paſt for reſcinding and repealing of ſuch former acts of Parliaments as repugne the acts and concluſions of the Aſſembly, which is conceived to be ſo abſolutelie neceſſar, as there neither can be a valide Parliament, without the ſame; nor can the acts and concluſions of the generall Aſſembly be ratified; which to refuſe were both contrar to the principall end, for which the Parliament was indicted, and againſt your Majeſties royall and gracious Declarations; And that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17384:53"/>(without paſſing the reſciſſorie act and act of conſtitution) to have a valide Parliament, to ratifie the concluſions of the Aſſembly, is manifeſt: Seeing by the former conſtitution of the Parliament, no act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament can paſſe without the conſent of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, of which the Kirk was the third; As is to bee ſeen by the act of Parliament 1609. And any act for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the concluſions of the aſſembly, or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe whatſoever, which can be paſt in this Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament (till the Parliament be lawfully conſtitute with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prelates, or any other repreſenting the Kirk) cannot be valid, but may be quarrelled and annulled, upon that formall and fundamentall ground of the former conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Parliament, which ſtands eſtabliſhed by the acts of Parliament 1584.1587.1597. and 1606. By all which it is clear, that the Parliament was conſtitute of the three Eſtates, whereof the Kirk is one, &amp; that no act of Parliament could be made, but by the ſpecial advice &amp; conſent of the three eſtates; &amp; that the Prelats voting in parliament, and repreſenting of the third Eſtate, was a priviledge granted to the Kirk; and that they as her office-bearers had onely vote in name of the Kirk, may be clearly ſeen by the 231. <hi>act. Par.</hi> 15.1597. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 6. Where the Kings Majeſtie, and his Highneſſe Eſtates, reſtores Miniſters provyded to Prelacies, to have vote in Parliament, and that upon this reaſon, as having ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conſideration of the great priviledges and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities granted by his predeceſſours, to the holy Kirk within this Realme: and to the ſpeciall perſons exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the office, dignitie, and title of prelats within the ſame, which have repreſented one of the Eſtates: And that the ſaids prelats have been from time to time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the ſame integritie wherein they were at any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17384:54"/>time before; So that his Majeſtie, out of his ſingular affection to the advancement of Religion, declares this Kirk to be a true and holy Kirk, and that the Miniſters and paſtors within the ſaid Kirk, provided to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, place, title, and dignitie of a Biſhop or prelat, ſhall at all time hereafter have vote in parliament, ſuchlike and as freely as any other Eccleſiaſtick prelat had at any time bygone. And that all Biſhopricks ſhall be diſponed to actuall preachers, which proves, that in time of poperie, and ever untill that time 1597. this priviledge of vote in Parliament was granted to the Kirk, and only to the ſpeciall perſons, who by vertue of their office, did repreſent the Kirk, which is alſo clear from the act of annexation 1587. whereby all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities of benefices were annexed to the Crowne, notwithſtanding whereof they did vote ſtill in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in name of the Kirk, (having no Temporalities at all) till the Parliament in the yeare 1606, Wherein it is clear in the act of reſtitution of the eſtate of Biſhops: And alſo in the 6. act of the Parliament 1609, That vote in Parliament is given to prelats, as one of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and liberties granted to the Kirk, whom they did repreſent, and did ever ſit <hi>pro Clero</hi> upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties right hand, and voyce in name of the Kirk.</p>
                        <p>But ſeeing in the late Generall Aſſembly holden at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (after particular inquyrie anent the true and reall cauſes of the evils which did ſo much trouble the peace of that Kirk and Kingdome) It is found that the government of the Kirk by Biſhops, and civill pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and power of Kirk-men, eſpecially their voting in Parliament, amongſt other novations brought in that Kirk, were two mayne cauſes of theſe evills. And that the Generall Aſſembly, with conſent of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17384:54"/>Commiſſioner, repreſenting your royall power and perſon, hath removed Epiſcopacie our of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and declared all civill places and power of Kirk-men to be unlawfull in that Kingdome, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Confeſſion of faith, and conſtitutions of that Kirk, and hath ratified the Covenant, ordaining all the ſubjects to ſubſcryve the ſame, with the generall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies explanation in that ſenſe: And your Majeſtie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to ratifie the concluſions of the aſſemblie in Parliament, It doth neceſſarily follow, that Biſhops who uſurped to bee the Kirk, and did in name of the Kirk, repreſent the third Eſtate, be taken away; which alſo by neceſſar conſequence doth inferre, that there be an act of conſtitution of the Parliament without them, and an act for repealing the former Laws wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Kirk was declared the third Eſtate, and Biſhops did repreſent the Kirk. Both which, the Kirk hath now renounced and condemned as a detriment and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice incompatible with her ſpirituall nature: Neither doth the paſſing of theſe acts, wrong the Kirk nor State, nor diminiſh your Majeſties Princely power; as was demonſtrat by that which was ſpoken to your Majeſtie the 3. of March, and which we did thereafter preſent to your Majeſtie in writ, which (for brevitie) wee abſteine to repeat. And if your Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner deny, that he did conſent to the act of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Auguſt 17, whereby Epiſcopacie, and the civill places and power of Kirk-men, and in ſpeciall their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Parliament, was declared to be unlawfull, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrare to the Confeſſion of faith, and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Kirk; and that he did approve, that all the ſubjects ſhould ſubſcryve the Confeſſion of faith, with the generall aſſemblies explanation; we offer to prove
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17384:55"/>the ſame by the very acts of the aſſembly, and records thereof, bearing his aſſent, firſt verbally, and there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, given in by writ: The trueth whereof wee are able alſo to verifie and make good, by witneſſes of all ranks of perſons, who were preſent at the aſſembly: And ſo ſoone as theſe Declarations which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner cauſed regiſtrate in the bookes of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, as being emitted by him in the generall aſſembly, were required to be inſert in the records of aſſembly, (which was eight dayes at leaſt after the riſing of the aſſembly) The Commiſſioners of the Kirk diſcharged the Clerk to inſert the ſame, as not being emitted in the aſſembly, and as contrarie to the acts thereof, and true declarations made by the Commiſſioner in the generall aſſembly, which are regiſtrate in the bookes thereof, and doeth beare his conſent, for which he got publick thanks.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of that article craving <hi>every Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Shyres to have a ſever all voyce,</hi> appeares in the very propoſition it ſelf; For that any who by the lawes of the Kingdome, and by their commiſſions, comes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, as Commiſſioners, to heare, treat, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in Parliament, and yet not to have a deciſive voice in Parliament, ſeemes to be <hi>repugnans in adjecto;</hi> and that by the ancient practiſe, the whole Barons and Free-holders within that Kingdome, had vote in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, may be ſeen in the old records of Parliament, as in the reigne of <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 1. in his 6. and 7. Parl. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 2. in the old acts, <hi>fol.</hi> 26.33, 36. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 3. in the 112. act. Parl. 14. <hi>Item</hi> Parl. 1487. 15. October. The Parliament being continued, all freeholders are enjoyned to come to Parliament, to treat and conclude, notwithſtanding whereof no ſuch priviledge was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17384:55"/>claimed in this Parliament, but onelie craved the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and determination of the Parliament, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther each Commiſſioner of the two ſent from a Shyre, have right in law of a ſeverall deciſive voice, which if at any time it hath been marked otherwayes; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame hath proceeded from the ignorance, errour, or corruption of the Clerk: And as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Free-holders are the far greateſt part of the body of that Kingdome, and that all of them of old had voice in Parliament, till their abſence by ſome late acts, eſpecially <hi>the</hi> 101 <hi>act. Par.</hi> 7. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 1. <hi>and Par. in anno</hi> 1587. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 6. is diſpenſed with, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eimed from neceſſitie of coming, and of the unlaws, which they were lyable to pay for none compeirance, providing they ſend Commiſſioners in their names to vote in Parliament: They think it agreeable both with law and reaſon, that every one of theſe few Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, who do repreſent ſo many, ſhould have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall deciſive voice. And the <hi>act of Parl. holden by K. J.</hi> 6. <hi>an.</hi> 1587. bears that the Commiſſioners of Shyres, ſhall be equall upon articles with the Burrowes, and ſhall have votes in Parliament: The meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth import, that every one of the ſaids Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners ſhall have a deciſive voice, becauſe <hi>quod de om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus dicitur, de ſingulis dicitur:</hi> and if both the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of one Shyre, ſhould have but one deciſive voyce, then it would follow, that every one of them hath but half a voice; and conſequently when the one is abſent, the other being preſent, ſhould have no voice, and one could not bee choſen upon the articles without the other; both which are contrare to reaſon and cuſtome. And it is undenyablie true and conſtant, by continuall cuſtome, that when there is onely one of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17384:56"/>the two Commiſſioners of a Shyre, choſen upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that one by himſelf without concurſe of his collegue hath a plenarie voice in articles: Therefore it follows neceſſarly, that as every one of two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, have a full voyce in articles, ſo each one of the two ſhould have a full voice <hi>perſe,</hi> and ſeverally in Parliament; otherwiſe every one of them would have but half a voice in Parliament, and a full voice in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: And the act given in <hi>anent the Barons voices,</hi> is not to demand or crave any new thing, or novation, or new priviledge to bee granted to them, but onely craves the declaration and determination of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in juſtice may bee craved by any who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their right to be cleared: Neither is there any ſuch thing craved in Parliament, as the choſing of any other Clerk, but it was onely humbly craved, that ſome ſhould bee allowed from the Parliament, to ſit by the Clerks, to mark that the voices were rightly enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</p>
                        <p>That article whereby it is craved, <hi>That every Eſtate may choſe their own Lords of articles,</hi> or elſe, <hi>That the Lords of articles be choſen from the whole Parliament,</hi> is agreeable to the libertie of all free judicatories, who have power to choſe their own preparative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, who except they be choſen by the judicatorie it ſelfe, or by theſe whom they do repreſent, cannot be juſtly reput to have any power from them; for their power is onely from them, from whom they are dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, and they can onely propone, or voice in articles, in name of theſe who did choſe them, and gave them power; and what they do in name of theſe who did not give them power, is, <hi>a non habente poteſtatem:</hi> But becauſe the reaſon of this article is more fully cleared
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17384:56"/>in one of our former anſwers, anent the power of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which is coincident with this article, wee remit to the former anſwer.</p>
                        <p>The reaſons of that act, deſiring that <hi>proxies may bee diſcharged, and that no patent of Nobilitie be granted to any but ſuch as have</hi> 10000 <hi>marks of yearly land rent;</hi> are contained in the act it ſelf, &amp; it ſeems not to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reaſon and equitie, That the honour and power of voting in Parliament, which is conferred on Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and their ſucceſſours perſonally, and whereby they have power to reaſon, voice, and judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law and conſcience, can be intruſted to another, with an implicit faith; to determine and give the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the granter of the <hi>proxie,</hi> in matters of higheſt moment, concerning Religion, your Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the good of the Countrey, before the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof know ſo much, as what is to bee proponed in Parliament: And as concerning the ſecond part of the act, craving that no patent of Nobilitie may bee granted, to any who are not Natives, but ſuch as have 10000 marks of Land rent: The ſame was remitted and recommended to the Commiſſioner, to bee repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and remonſtrat to your Majeſtie, whoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anſwer they do expect.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the book intituled, <hi>(A large declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> The generall Aſſembly taking notice thereof, and conceiving that thereby your Majeſtie, that Kirk, and whole Kingdome is wronged; did give in a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Commiſſioner, and Lords of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties privie Councel, humbly craving to repreſent the ſame to your Majeſties gracious conſideration: Like-as in the articles of Parliament, the Eſtates did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly recommend the Aſſemblies ſupplication to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17384:57"/>Commiſſioner, for obtaining graciouſly the deſire of the ſaid ſupplication: Neither did they know a more humble and reſpective way for redreſſe and removing theſe imputations which lyes upon them by occaſion of that book: concerning which, amongſt the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars recommended to the Commiſſioner, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to your Majeſtie. They do confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the return of your gracious anſwer.</p>
                        <p>As concerning that propoſition, whereby it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, <hi>That the Commiſsioners of Shyres may be allowed, to give in a roll of free holders, out of the which the Juſtices of peace are to bee choſen:</hi> The reaſon of that deſire is, Becauſe the Commiſſioner of each ſeverall Shyre, knows beſt who are the fitteft and ableſt men, within their own ſeverall Shyres, for your. Majeſties ſervice, and the good of the Countrey, which is no wayes craved to derogat from your Majeſties power of choſing; but onely as an expedient, to be paſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, as your Majeſtie, and the Parliament, ſhall think convenient.</p>
                        <p>As concerning that act anent <hi>the diſorders in the North:</hi> The reaſon why the ſame was craved, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from the complaints and grievances, againſt the thift, oppreſsion, ſlaughter, and great inſolencies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theſe diverſe years bygone, and of late in thoſe parts; the redreſſe and remedie whereof, and for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace in that part of the Countrey, deſerves your Majeſties conſideration and juſtice: And all that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member was required of the Parliament was, That the former acts of Parliament made for puniſhment of thift, rapine, and oppreſsion, might be revived, with ſuch farther addition, as your Majeſtie ſhould finde expedient, and conduceable for the peace of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17384:57"/>which wee hope your Majeſtie will ever ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of that article, or act, craving <hi>the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to be ſubalterne, and cenſurable by the Parliament,</hi> Is from the warrant of former Lawes, cited in the act it ſelf, wherein there is no more craved, but that the former acts of Parliament, againſt leaſing makers, and makers of diviſion betwixt the King and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, may bee revived; And that the Councell and Seſſion, may bee comptable to your Majeſtie, and the Parliament, for any injuſtice ſhall happen to bee committed by them.</p>
                        <p>Where it is alledged, there was one article, <hi>That no taxation ſhould bee granted, but in plaine Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we remember of no ſuch article or motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the <hi>act of pacification,</hi> The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ground thereof, flowes from the humble petitions and remonſtrances of your Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, wherein they did cleare their loyaltie, and made offer of their civill and duetifull obedience to your Majeſtie. And which by their humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to your Majeſties Commiſſioner, and Lords of Councell, and to the Eſtates of Parliament, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and regiſtrat in the records thereof, They have againe ſolemnely renewed. And from your Majeſties favour, in condeſcending to the articles of pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein your Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed, That an act of pacification or oblivion, ſhould be paſt: And in the narrative of the Act it ſelfe, there is one humble and thankfull acknowledgement of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties goodnes and Juſtice, and is drawne up in ſuch termes, as was conceived, might beſt expreſſe your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17384:58"/>Majeſties fatherly care and goodneſſe, toward your ancient and native Kingdome, without wronging the true and loyall meaning and intention of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects: And as for the body and legall part of the act, the ſame was after much debating, framed with advyce of Lawyers, and conſented unto by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties chiefly intereſſed.</p>
                        <p>As to that article anent <hi>particular commiſsions of Juſticiarie and Lievtennandrie,</hi> all which was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or deſired thereby, was, That the abuſes of theſe commiſſions, might be in all humilitie repreſented to your Majeſtie, by your Commiſſioner: And that your Majeſtie might be graciouſly pleaſed, to grant the like commiſſions, onely upon weightie and neceſſar cauſes, and to endure onely during the time of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the ingivers of the act was content to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that way.</p>
                        <p>As concerning that act given in <hi>for ſheriffes and ſtewards, craving that they might only be oblidged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hornings for the taxation;</hi> It is not a new deſire, but that which hath been craved by them in diverſe former Parliaments; And they think, that producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of horning againſt the perſons lyable in payment, ſhould bee an exoneration to them; becauſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they want many of the caſualities and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which Sheriffes had of old by vertue of their office.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the propoſition which was made, <hi>anent the patent for making of powder,</hi> All that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member was craved by the in-givers of that article, was, that in reſpect the <hi>Earle of Linlithgowes</hi> patent, was voyde by a clauſe irritant in his patent, whereby he was oblidged to keep the Works going, and which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17384:58"/>are now decayed, and the Countrey fruſtrate of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and profit which might have accreſſed to them through that commoditie: That therefore it might be allowed to any who were moſt fit and able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the worke to make powder.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the act given in <hi>for diſcharge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions for murther, ſlaughter, theft, but upon ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the partie;</hi> All that was intended or craved thereby, was onely, That the heavie prejudices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to the Countrey by remiſſions, purchaſed upon miſinformation, might be by ſupplication pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your Majeſties conſideration; That by your Majeſties goodneſſe and juſtice, the like inconveniences in time coming may be prevented.</p>
                        <p>As for that act craving <hi>diſcharge of protections,</hi> there was nothing craved thereby, but the reviving of two former acts of Parliament, viz: the 47. <hi>act. Parl.</hi> 11. and 13. <hi>act</hi> of the 23. <hi>Parl. K. Ja.</hi> 6. without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to your Majeſties power or authoritie, which was done with the Commiſſioners conſent: Likeas it was recommended to him, to repreſent the ſame to your Majeſtie, with the reaſons thereof.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of the act of <hi>common reliefe,</hi> is, Becauſe as the bleſsings of Religion and peace, which from your Majeſties happy governement and fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to your Majeſties ancient and native Kingdome, eſpecially at this troubleſome time, are common bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, whereof every good ſubject ought to be ſenſible. So is it agreeable with reaſon and juſtice, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their intereſt, every one may contribute a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall part of the charges, which hath been ſpent for ſo good ends, and the ordinar cauſe for which taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are granted, are <hi>ad relevationem imperii, ob con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervationem
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17384:59"/>libertatis ac dignitatis, ac religionis, vel ob utilitatem communem ſubditorum,</hi> wherefrom albeit ſome be averſe, yet the conſent and voices of the moſt part ſhould oblige for theſe ends, whereunto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties conſent, and royall authoritie is humbly craved to be added, that the ſame may flow from your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties goodneſſe and Juſtice, and have execution to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre payment thereof, ſeeing the whole Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Shyres, and Burrowes, and the whole Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (very few excepted) are content freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to make offer of their proportionall part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p>As for that article craving the act 1633. <hi>(ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that confirmations and infeftments of Waird lands, ſhall not prejudge the Kings Waird)</hi> to bee repealed, There was no diſpute nor concluſion made there-anent in articles, neither (as we remember) was it craved by that article, that the act 1633. bee repealed ſimply, but that the meaning of that act may be explained and interpreted.</p>
                        <p>As for the article or act, anent <hi>the duetic payed to the conſervatour upon coale,</hi> The ſame is craved to bee diſcharged by the coal-maſters, becauſe it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull exaction, which he had no warrant to exact by his gift, which was inſtructed in articles by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his gift, whereupon the act was paſt in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
                        <p>The deſire, craving <hi>ammunition, and armes brought in, to be cuſtome-free,</hi> is warranted in Law, in ſo farre as the commodities either expected or imported for the particular uſe of Noblemen, Barons, and Free-holders, which are for their owne uſe, and not to be ſold againe, are by act of Parliament declared to be cuſtome-free.</p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:17384:59"/>
                        <p>As concerning the article anent <hi>the election of the Preſident of the Seſsion, and admiſsion of the Judges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by his Majeſty,</hi> There was no new thing craved thereby, but the ratifying and approving of the 39. <hi>act. Par.</hi> 6. <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 6. 1579. And that allanerly in ſo farre as concernes the freedome of election, to be made by the Senatours: of the Colledge of Juſtice, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident thereof, without any other clauſe of the ſaid act: Neither doth the act given in, beare any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the admiſsion of any other Judges preſented by your Majeſtie.</p>
                        <p>As for that article, anent <hi>Stateſmen, being Noblemen, to have but one voice,</hi> we remember nothing of any ſuch queſtion.</p>
                        <p>As to the laſt propoſition, Concerning <hi>the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by the reſt of the Clerks, againſt Maſter</hi> William Hayes <hi>deputation in his fathers place:</hi> The Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to whom they did produce their reaſons in writ, can beſt give an accompt thereof.</p>
                        <p>And albeit wee have in obedience to your Majeſties commandement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to our bound duetie, ſhown the reaſons why theſe propoſitions (whereof your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie hath taken notice, as prejudiciall to your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie) were demanded, yet many of theſe propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of ſo ſmall moment, being onely and me erely about the intereſt of privat perſons, as they are of no publick concernement, <hi>&amp; de minimis non curat lex.</hi> Nor doth the Parliament ſtick upon theſe or any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of that kind any farder; nor as they have cleare warrant of Law, and as your Majeſtie and Eſtates ſhall find them convenient for the good of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: But the humble and earneſt deſire of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Parliament, is, That ſeeing wee have ſhowne
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17384:60"/>your Majeſtie their humble deſires, and reaſons of their demands) your Majeſtie may bee graciouſly pleaſed to command the Parliament to proceede, and ratifie the concluſions of the Aſſemblie, and paſſe ſuch acts as are neceſſar for eſtabliſhing of Religion, and for the good and peace of the Kingdome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the articles of pacification, That by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall embracement of Religion, and Juſtice, under your Majeſties happie government, Trueth and peace may kiſſe one another, and the joy and chearefull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of your Majeſties Subjects may bee encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

            <p>After the deliverie and reading of which anſwers, and anſwering all objections which were proponed by his Majeſtie, or thoſe of the Committee thereupon, (which our Commiſsioners immediatly after their parting with his Majeſtie, did put in writ) They declared that they had according to their Inſtructions, with honeſt and willing hearts performed that charge which was laid upon them, and did ſhow his Majeſtie, how much Religion, and that whole Kingdome did ſuffer by delayes: And that it would pleaſe his Majestie to give them their diſpatch, that they might returne to thoſe that ſent them, who are longing much for the returne of his Majeſties gracious anſwer. Being thereafter removed, and within the ſpace of halfe an houre called in; The Kings Majeſtie ſaid, That hee could not now appoint them any time for diſpatch: But that his Majeſtie would take his owne time to conſider of their anſwers, and would then make his farther pleaſure knowne to them.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:17384:60"/>
            <p>AFter that our Commiſsioners had thus acted their part faithfully, in what was committed to them by us, demanded of them by the King, and could be expected from them by others: This Declaration cometh forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Majeſties name, which may make his Majeſties pleaſure knowne to them, and no more but known, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut up and one of the Noblemen put in priſon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome pretenſions of our powerfull enemies (which what they are ſhall appear afterward) ſo that they are deprived not onely of the benefit of further hearing, but of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to juſt fie themſelves, and their proceedings. A neceſsitie therefore is laid upon us to compare the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with the Declaration, that if there be any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, accuſations, or objections (as we beleeve there bee few or none) which have not been proponed to them, they may now be examined by us and ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the forme of electing the articles, nothing can be ſaid by us, which can ſo ſatisfie the minds of ſuch as are not acquainted with this difficulty, as the article it ſelf as it was conceived, (which yet with other particulars of this kinde we are conſtrained to ſpare, leſt theſe papers grow to a greater bigneſſe then wee intended) for the article is diſjunctive, that either the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or each eſtate by themſelves ſeverally ſhall chooſe the articles: And therefore although it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by ſome practicks, that every Eſtate did not chooſe their ovn articles, but that they were choſen by the whole Parliament, this doth not militat againſt us, but falleth into the other part of the diſjunction contained in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: We holding this conſtantly, that neither by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Parliament which are keeped up from us, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we appeal, nor (ſo farre as we can learne of old
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17384:61"/>Noblemen who have aſsiſted in Parliament for many years) by the testimonies of Parliamentarie men in the yeare 1609. and 1612. ſpecified in the Declaration pag. 21. or any other year before 1617 can it be ſhowne that the forme uſed ſince the year 1617. had place in the election of the articles; it was introduced with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, and muſt go forth with them again: it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Biſhops having no place in Parliament by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the act of Aſſembly, and of his Majeſties Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, promiſing to confirme the acts of the Aſſembly, can have any place in the articles. And therefore that it was neceſſarie that the election of the articles ſhould be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the forme uſed before 1617. even when Prelats had voice in Parliament; which can neither reflex upon his Majeſties royall authoritie, nor upon the internall life, or externall luſtre and glorie of the high court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What is objected for the power of the articles, Declaration pag. 21. is ſo clearly and fully anſwered by our Commiſsioners, pag. 19, 20, 21. that nothing more Nothing can belong to them by vertue of any precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding act of Parliament, or by the nature of the thing it ſelf, which is to be a preparatory committee for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that ſhall by us be denyed, although it muſt be confeſſed that it belongeth properly to the Parliament to determine their power, as in their wiſedome they ſhall finde convenient.</p>
            <p>Concerning the conſtitution of the Parliament, it was neceſſar that it ſhould ſuffer alſo ſome alteration, but that was accidentall and by inevitable conſequence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon the act of the Aſſembly, and ſubſcription of the Covenant by his Majeſties Commiſsioner, and upon his Majeſties irrevocable Declaration, which can never bee interpreted to have any affinitie with Treaſon ſpoken of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17384:61"/>in the Declaration, except we will ſay that the Kings Majestie and the whole Eſtates of Parliament who have full and uncontrolable power to make and aboliſh laws can runne themſelves in the guiltineſſe of that crime up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on changing of their own laws and cuſtomes: the fear is greater, that acts of Parliament made for the advantage and advancement of Prelats againſt the Confeſsion of Faith and Covenant of God, and againſt many proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Kirkbe Laeſ-Majeſtie divine to be repented of, leſt it pull down upon us the wrath threatned this day.</p>
            <p>Acts of reſciſſion or repealing are ſo neceſſar, that it were not onely an incongruitie, but a repugnance to make a new act, and withall to ſuffer former acts ordaining the contrarie to ſtand in vigour, and not to aboliſh them: but the cauſe of quarrelling is in the matter of this act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſsion, which cannot be remeeded, except by reſcinding of the act of Aſſembly, of the Confeſsion of faith and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and of his Majeſties Declaration which wee truſt ſhall never be repented of, ſince it can be no diminution of his Majeſties right or power in Aſſembly or Parliament; and ſince the Paſtors of the Kirk deſire not to meddle with the civil affairs of the Kingdome, and are heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for their means of life and any temporall thing that they poſſeſſe, to be repreſented by the temporall eſtates of Parliament, as the reſt of his Majeſties Subjects are, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their calling or qualitie be. Were the fountains and firſt originall of this place and power of ſpirituall or Kirk Lords diſcovered, they would be found ſo bitter and venemous both to King and people, that they would be ſoone diſguſted of them, and would be glad to apprehend the opportunitie of the temperament and moderation of Kirkmen, willing to ſequeſtrat themſelves to the care of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17384:62"/>ſouls from State affairs, and ſecular government, which have ever proven unluckie in their hands, as never being created of God for ſuch a worke, and the bane of Religion, and the ſervice of God, as we of late and many other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before us have found.</p>
            <p>It is known that an act of oblivion in ſuch a caſe of peace making and accommodating of affairs, is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from an act of Remiſsion: for although it beſeemeth not Subjects to ſtand upon pointiles, ſubtilties, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements with their Prince, yet knowing the minds and malice of our adverſari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And reſolving to remain conſtant in the Confeſsion of our own innocency, that we had neither deſerved the imputation of Rebellion and Treaſon, nor yet any hoſtilitie and invaſion, but were certain our ſelves, and laboured to certifie the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of our uprightneſſe and ſincerity in all our actions, we judged it moſt reaſonable in humilitie to acknowledge his Majeſties juſtice, goodneſſe, and fatherly care in giving way to the ſettling of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The anſwers of our Commiſsioners, Concerning the act of reliefe, and the Five demands, pag. <hi>26. 27.</hi> and to many other propoſitions made to them, are ſo full, that we need to adde nothing; Our adverſaries have concealed more of the grounds of our actions as they are proponed by our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners, ſuppoſing, it may be, that they ſhuld ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee the light, then they have oppoſed unto the truth ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſe

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17384:63"/>of our King we be deprived of the opportunity and means, that they may wiſh the like happines unto us here: Neither ſhall there be any favour put upon our poſtnati amongſt them in Parliament, or otherwayes, but we ſhall ſtrive in all thankfulnes to equall it according to our ſmall power. But withall we wiſh that our unworthy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured Countrey men may find ſmall reſpect there: and ſuch as are highly reſpected and honoured, forget not in the time of neceſsity the Religion and liberties, the ſoul and life of the mother that bore them, and the breaſts that give them ſuck.</p>
            <p>When the Parliament had proceeded in their articles and demands after this manner, and upon very good grounds we promiſed unto our ſelves a peaceable concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Lord Commiſsioner ſheweth, that it is his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties will that the Parliament be prorogated to the 2. of June, and that by his Majeſties authority only: of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, the praetenſion is pag. 30. that our aime was not now for Religion, but to alter the whole frame of civill governement: The deduction of our proceedings by our Commiſsioners hath ſhown what our aime hath been, and what reaſons and means we have uſed to attain it. The ſetling of Religion, as it ſhould be determined in aſſembly, was promiſed. And therefore no neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, although importing ſome alteration in the members or order of the Parliament, ſhould have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. Other matters of Religion may be ſettled by Law, without the ſmalleſt alteration of Parliament. But when it is found by the Aſſembly of the Kirk to be againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that the Miniſters of Chriſt be Lords of Parliament, a change in Parliament muſt needs accompany it. Other things were promiſed, which might conduce for the good and peace of the Kingdome. The particulars which were

Of the proroguing of the Parliament by his Majeſties meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, the reaſon is given pag. 31. becauſe we had diſputed it: upon what grounds the diſpute was, may be apparant from the declaration of Parliament: Which we have here ſet down for two reaſons: One is, that it ſelf may be in ſtead of an anſwer againſt what is oppoſed. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we only deſire, that after the cenſure thereof is read, it may be read the ſecond time, and conſidered, and there will need no other reply: Another reaſon is, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may be ſeen betwixt the declaration which was made by us in the Parliament-houſe, and that which was printed by his Majeſties authority; we mean not eſcapes of the Printer, but willfull errours of the Author, that no man may any more be ignorant, how far the King there, and the Kingdome here are abuſed; we ſuppoſe the Reader to be honeſt and judicious, that we need not inſist in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cauſes why ſuch and ſuch parts of our Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are left out: and therfore will content our ſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the words and clauſes which are paſt over in a ſmal Character.</p>

And wee doe further declare, that any prorogation made by the Commiſſioners Grace alone, without conſent of the Parliament by himſelfe, or any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner in his name, or under the quarter Seal, or by the Lords of the Councell, who have no power at all in matter of the Parliament during the ſitting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhall be ineffectuall, and of no force at all to hinder
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17384:65"/>the lawfull proceedings of the Subjects, and the doers thereof to be cenſurable in Parliament. And farther we declare, that the Commiſſioner his nomination of the articles by himſelf, his calling together theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and commanding them to ſit continually, and proceed, notwithſtanding their day lie proteſtations to the contrair, his keeping frequent Seſſions of Councell, and determining cauſes in Councell during the time of the Seſſion in Parliament, his calling down and calling up of money enduring the Seſſion of the Parliament, without conſent of the Eſtates of Parliament, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the Parliament had taken the money to their conſideration, and had purpoſe to have given their advice for a determination there-anent, his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prorogating the ryding of the Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent of the Eſtates, or mentioning in the acts of prorogation the conſent of the articles, although it was done by their advice, are contrary to the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Kingdome, freedome and cuſtome of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that they be no preparatives, practiques, nor prejudices in time coming againſt us or our ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.

            <p>BEtwixt the prorogation of the Parliament and the ſending of our laſt Commiſsioners, three points are touched in the Declaration: One, that the Earl of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermling,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lowdoun</hi> were ſent with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Parliament, to make their remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance to his Majeſtie, but were not admitted to his preſence, and were commanded to returne; becauſe they were not licenced or warranted by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, and had not acquainted him with their propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions: Although it be of verity that the Commiſsioner had ſhowen to diverſe of the members of the Parliament, his Majeſties own warrant for the coming of ſome to his Majeſties preſence, which to them ſeemed more ſufficient and of greater authority, then any thing they could have from himſelf; and why might not they have ſome things to propone or to complain of upon the Commiſsioner to his Majestie, which was not ſitting to acquaint him with, that his Majeſtie in his fatherly affection, which cannot be tranſmitted to another, might judge between him and them: It was in his Majeſties power to give ſuch anſwer to their propoſitions as ſeemed good in his own royal wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but to comand them who had not bin ſent without his Majeſties warrant, to return unheard, after ſo long a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, was more then could have been expected or ſuſpected by a Kingdome conveened in Parliament by his Majeſties authoritie. The ſecond is, that the Earle of Traquair at his coming made a large and exact repreſentation to the Councel of <hi>England,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> he moſt conſiderable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters proponed in Parliament: of the largenes of his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wee doubt not, but how exact it was our adverſaries can beſt diſcover, who had taught him before ſo to ſay his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17384:67"/>leſſon in publick, as might ſerve moſt for the ends intended by them, eſpecially to animat <hi>England</hi> againſt us, for which they have ſet their wits ſince the treatie of peace to make all means, whereof this was a powerfull one, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operat. The third is, the judgement of the Lords of his Majesties councel of <hi>England,</hi> to reduce us to our duetie by force, rather then to give way to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Of which we ſay no further, but that it was the ſentence of a Councel, and of the Councel of <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Parliament, and the Parliament of another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: That it was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

In Councel is ſtability, but this is found not by precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but after many dayes agitation, when the matters debated are more then ordinarie, and ſuch as, it may be, fall not to be conſidered, once in many ages. To us we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, it ſeemed incredible at firſt, and afterward a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of demurre and aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>Although our Commiſsioners formerly ſent, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, yet we did not deſiſt, but remembring that we were dealing with our own native King, who might be moved to know and compaſsionat us his own people at laſt, we ſent this humble ſupplication for a new hearing.</p>

            <p>VPon this anſwer foure Commiſsioners were ſent, who did acquite themſelves in their charge, as is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before in their Supplications, ſpeeches, anſwers, and whole proceedings: Concerning which there be three things mentioned in the Declaration to make them all null and themſelves odious; Firſt, that they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with ſufficient Commiſsion, which is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered by themſelves pag. 14. For their commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17384:69"/>behoved to be deficient, either in the forme and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or in the ſubject and matters to be treated: The authoritie was as great as firſt the Parliament then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and thereafter the Commiſsioners of the Parliament could grant: And where it is ſaid pag. 44. that they were perſons of no great eminencie who did ſubſcribe: Their Commiſsion we deſire to be conſidered, 1. That the firſt commiſsion was ſubſcribed by the Subjects of every qualitie ſitting in Parliament: 2. That the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion could not be ſubſcribed in that manner, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being no more ſitting but prorogated, but behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſubſcribed by the Commiſsioners of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, authorized to ſit at Edinburgh for making remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, and receiving anſwers from his Majeſtie. The meaneſt of theſe Commiſsioners whoſoever he was in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was in this act, of greater authoritie and eminencie, then the most eminent in the Kingdome, who was not clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the ſame commiſsion: And therefore although there were many Noblemen in Edinburgh for the time, yet they did not ſigne the commiſsion, becauſe they had no warrant from the Parliament, and that for me of doing hath been reprehended in former times as diſpleaſant to his Majeſtie, and ſo was the authority ſufficient. As for their limitation in the matters to be treated before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, it may appear by his Majeſties allowing them to come up under the Secretaries hand, that they went to give the reaſons of the demands made in Parliament, and withall did declare as is contained in their proceedings, pag. 45. <q>that the Parliament doth not ſtick upon theſe or any other articles of that kinde any further, nor as they have clear warrant of law, and as his Majeſtie and the Eſtates ſhall find them convenient for the good of the Subjects. And did ſupplicat that his Majeſtie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17384:70"/>would be pleaſed to command the Parliament to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and ratifie the concluſions of the Aſſembly, and paſſe ſuch acts as are neceſſarie for eſtabliſhing Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the good and peace of the Kingdome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the articles of pacification.</q>

            <p>Another particular is mentioned in the Declaration pag. 46. The neglect of a Ceremony and complement witneſsing in our Commiſsioners the ſenſe of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Grace and goodneſſe in hearing them who had no power to accomodat affaires: which how it was wee know not, but his Majeſtie knoweth well that the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation glorieth more in kindneſſe and realities then in expreſsions by word or geſture: they might alſo have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted a thankſgiving at that time when they were ſo ſerious, to have been a loſſe, or interruption in buſineſſe, or have feared the aſperſion of gloſsing, faining, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which hath been put upon us before. And it may bee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17384:74"/>that their ſenſe was the leſſe, becauſe they conceived their inſtructions to be full: As they were obliged to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord Marqueſse of <hi>Hammiltoun,</hi> named here for this good office; ſo are we all longing for the happy time when our hearts ſhall be ſo far affected with the ſenſe of his Majeſties grace and goodneſſe, that our Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may bee turned in thankſgiving to God and the King, our troubles into a firme peace, and all our cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and complaints into acclamations of joy, at which time there ſhall be no want of Ceremonie, thanſgiving, or gratulation from the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>The third is, <q>That the anſwers of our Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were impertinent, &amp;c. pag. 47. And that the Lords of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Councell were of opinion that our Commiſſioners ought not to bee heard till they ſhould acknowledge that the Supreame magiſtrate muſt have authoritie to call and diſſolve Aſſemblies, and to have a negatiue voice in them, &amp;c.</q> If their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers did give the reaſons of the demands in Parliament, as it may appear by their proceedings, they did, in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as were controverted: for other demands there was no juſt exception againſt them, as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, Declaration Pag. 45. 47. they were not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent but ſatisfactorie, although they did not ſatisfie our adverſaries, who were determined to receive no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but in the overthrow either of our Religion and Liberties, or of our ſelves: It could not in reaſon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that three or foure Commiſsioners ſhould hold a Parliament there with a Committee, and leave nothing to a Parliament here, but an approbation of their doing: This hath more in it then can be told in few words. It had been good before the Councel of <hi>England</hi> had given their opinion, which we beleeve was not their ſentence,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17384:75"/>that they had called to their remembrance, that our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners were ſent not to give judgement, but to give the reaſons of our demands, and that they behoved to keep themſelves within the compaſſe of their inſtructions, that in the time of the peace making, his Majeſtie thought it not meet to inſiſt in the three Querees, of calling and diſſolving Aſſemblies, and of a negative voice, as may be ſeene before in the firſt part of this anſwer pag. 13. And that his Majeſtie did graciouſly acknowledge that all matters Eccleſiaſticall, (whereof, this being understood of the Aſſemblies of the Kirk, is one) ought to be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Aſſemblies of the Kirk, according as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the late generall Aſsembly, act. Auguſt. 17. of prorogating or diſſolving of Parliaments, and other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, our declaration ſpeaketh, pag. 55. What other ſupreame powers in the Chriſtian world, may do by their different laws, conſtitutions and cuſtomes, were long and laborous to enquire; but wee ſhall ſtrive to keep our own, without wronging any other Kingdome, either by our ſentence or opinion, eſpecially in times of danger.</p>
            <p>Before we come to the third part of the Declaration, we meet with the anſwer of three objections which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be made upon our part.</p>
            <p>The firſt is pag. 47. that his Majeſtie promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a free Parliament, and we adde that a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made of the ratification of the acts of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in Parliament, and of ſettling other ſuch things as may conduce to the good and peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Like as we were oblidged both by the nature of the thing it ſelf and our promiſe, To ſeek nothing but to enjoy our Religion and liberties, according to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and civil laws of the Kirk and Kingdome, and not to diminiſh his Majeſties greatneſſe and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17384:75"/>But when the Parliament is conveened, the acts of the Aſſembly are refuſed to be ratified, in ſo far that his Majeſties Commiſsioner refuſeth to repeall and reſcind ſuch acts of Parliament as are inconſiſtent with the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the acts of the Kirk; although it cannot upon any ſhadow of reaſon be denyed, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments power and freedome conſiſteth in this, to make and unmake laws, as in their prudence ſhall ſeem conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: Other articles which were proponed, as they were conceived to be for the peace and good of the Kingdome; ſo neither in the intention of the proponers, nor in their own nature and condition, did they touch or trench upon his Majeſties Glorie, Crowne, Sceptre, or Power, as is before made manifeſt; they all tending either to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible good of the Subject, or to the reforming of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes as do obſcure his Majeſties juſtice and goodneſſe, and being granted would conciliat love, reverence, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience to his Majeſties government.</p>
            <p>The ſecond objection ſuppoſed to be made by us: Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration pag. 48. is <q>from his Majeſties allowing of the Covenant, and commanding of the Lord Marqueſſe of <hi>Hammiltoun,</hi> the former high Commiſſioner, and other his Majeſties Subjects to ſubſcribe it, and from the Earle of <hi>Traquair,</hi> his Majeſties high Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, his ſubſcription or allowance of the ſubſcribing of the Covenant.</q> It was never in our mindes to make uſe of the firſt, our reaſons are extant in print againſt it, as ſubtilie diſappointing and deſtructive of our intended reformation, againſt the late novations, and againſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacie it ſelf, the waggoner which had brought them in; and when it was ſubſcribed by ſome few, it was done with this expreſſe Declaration, <q>That they ſubſcribe it in no other ſenſe, but that which it had in the yeare 1580,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17384:76"/>when it was at firſt ſubſcribed;</q> which is found by the Aſſemblies of the Kirk, (contrarie to the Lord Marqueſse his meaning) quite repugnant to Epiſcopacie, and all the attendants thereof in Kirk and State: wee indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it to be the ſame in ſubſtance, with that which we have ſubſcribed of late, but that, by our adverſaries, who ever ſet themſelves againſt our explanation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof to the late corruptions and innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was not acknowledged till the Aſsembly at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and by ſome of them is ſtill denyed; what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for the clearing this queſtion, was ſo fully written at that time, that nothing needeth now to be added. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Earle of <hi>Traquair,</hi> it is alleadged, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pag. 50. that we have no warrant for our actions, (for rebellious courſes and treacherous combinations, no man can have warrant, and we deteſt and diſclaime them) from his ſubſcription of the Covenant: Firſt, becauſe it is evinced by the petition of the Generall Aſſembly for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of the Covenant, that our ſubſcription before this time was neither laudable nor warrantable; where wee intreat the reader, whoſoever, to make ſome pauſe, and compare the words of the Supplication of the Aſſembly with the words of the Declaration.</p>
            <p>The words of the ſupplication as it was preſented before the Councel table, ſtandeth regiſtrat in the books of Aſſembly and Councell, is prefixed to many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed copies of the Covenant, even that which was ſubſcribed by the Commiſsioner and Councel, and is printed ſupra pag. 40.</p>

               </gap>ſt we deſire it to be known univerſally, that the Earle of <hi>Traquair</hi> his Majeſties Commiſsioner, did ſubſcribe the Confeſsion of Faith and Covenant, with the explanation of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: Firſt in the houſe of Parliament in preſence of the Lords of articles, Septemb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. both as Commiſsioner with the declaration made in the Aſſembly to be prefixed to his ſubſcription, and as <hi>Traquair</hi> ſimplie as other ſubjects
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17384:77"/>have done: Next, that he ſubſcribed the Covenant in the new houſe of Exchecquer, as a Counſellour with other prime Lords of Counſell, <hi>Roxburgh, Lawderdaile, Southesk,</hi> and many others, and that without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration at all, even the Marques of <hi>Huntlie</hi> ſhew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſubſcribe with others, but that he would have done it with proteſtation of his liberty outwith the Kingdome, which the Miniſters who were preſent to take the oath and ſubſcription of the Lords, could not admit. But neither his Lordſhip, nor any other, pretended any ſcruple either in Religion, or civill obedience to the King, againſt their ſubſcription; ſo that neither in the Aſſembly, nor in the Parliament-meeting of the articles, nor at the Councell Table, was there any ſuſpition of treaſonable combination againſt the King from this ſubſcription. Secondly, if both, that of the <hi>1580.</hi> and this of <hi>1638.</hi> be one, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this hath no more then that, and that hath no leſſe then this: Neither is there any other difference of the one from the other, but (as was expreſſed in our Proteſtation, Septemb. <hi>22. 1638.</hi>) <hi>ſuch as is of a march ſtone hid in the ground and uncovered, &amp;c.</hi> for this end, and for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving full ſatisfaction to authority; theſe words <q>

            <p>Our third objection is, That the demands proponed by

            <p>BY that which we have ſaid, we believe we are free, before, and in the Aſſembly and Parliament, of inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and the heavy cenſures of Rebellion and Treaſon, which are ſo ordinarily, and at every other word thundered out, that they are become the leſſe formidable unto us, who deſire that all our actions and proceedings in this cauſe, may be ſeen in their own colours, and who are ſupported with this inward teſtimony, that we fear God, and ſtill honour the King, although nothing can proceed from us which will pleaſe our adverſaries, except we will follow their rules, which are not unlike thoſe of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> found at <hi>Padua,</hi> when they were expelled the territory of <hi>Venice:</hi> One of them was, that <q>men ſhould take heed, that they preſſe or inculcat not too much the Grace of God;</q> Another was, that <q>men muſt beleeve the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchicall Church, although it tell us, that that is black which our ey judgeth to be white.</q> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which we may adde the third, invented by <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> of blinde
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17384:78"/>obedience, which we have no mind to practiſe, becauſe it is repugnant to the eſſence of the vertue of obedience, which proceedeth from knowledge and election. We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat our adverſaries to ſhew us in good earneſt, and not by way of railing, In what ſenſe have we incurred the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Rebellion and Treaſon in the Aſſembly (as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged pag. <hi>52.</hi>) The Aſſembly was conveened by his Majeſties authority, countenanced from the beginning to the end by his Majeſties high Commiſsioner, all things were done with high reſpect to the Kings Majeſtie, and with frequent prayers for his happines; Nothing was put in deliberation, till it was firſt proponed to his Majeſties Commiſsioner; nor any thing determined without his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, conſent and approbation, all was done in that order and decencie which this Nation, out of uſe of Aſſemblies, through the tiranny of Prelats, uſurping the juriſdiction of the Kirk, could attain unto at the firſt or ſecond time, and all was cloſed with rejoycing in God, and with many praiſes and prayers for the King, under whoſe Majeſtie the Commiſsioner alſo had his own part: And yet in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly we muſt be guilty of Rebellion and Treaſon, We cannot be mooved to think, but the mitre of an uſurping Prelat, by the authority of a Nationall Councell, may be thrown to the ground, without the violation or ſmalleſt touch of the Crown or Scepter of Imperiall Majeſty: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we deny both the Tenets of the Romaniſts: One, <q>
                  <hi>that the temporall power of Princes is directly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat and ſubject unto perſons Eccleſiaſticall, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all power given them of God.</hi>

And ſo we come to the anſwer of the third part of the Declaration, touching our faults ſince the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Not three or foure, but Ten tranſgreſsions and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies are here libelled againſt us. The firſt three are the provyding of men, munition, and moneyes for our own defence, which in us who are the Eſtates of a free King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is held lawfull by the Law of God and Nature, by our acts of Parliament, by the practiſe of other reformed Kirks, by the teſtimony of famous Divines, by the aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance contributed by our own Princes to other Kirks and States invaded and diſtreſsed, (and we adde) by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many amongſt our ſelves, who in the beginning of our troubles, and before the late pacification, had about this, their own ſcruples, wherein ſince, conſidering what is done in <hi>England</hi> for advancing of Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rie, and what is done at home expreſly againſt the articles of the pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they reſt perfectly ſatisfied. If the defence be lawful, the hands of men, and the aide of moneys are neceſſary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicles, which all the Subjects do acknowledge, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contribute moſt willingly without the leaſt exception, except of ſome few, not againſt the thing it ſelf, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſtint and proportion, which yet is leſſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in this, then it hath been at any time in ordinary Subſidies or taxes. It is known to the world, that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath no Treaſures whereof to boast; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary if we be blocked up, we will be neceſsitated either to famiſh, or to fight our ſelves free: And although we had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17384:79"/>the treaſures of <hi>Craeſus</hi> or <hi>Darius,</hi> we would not put our truſt in them. The ſentence of <hi>Q Curtius,</hi> which after him is become common in the world, crying up moneys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the juſt value, that they are the <hi>Sinewes of warre,</hi> is upon good grounds by wiſe men, and upon better experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, recalled and exploded. The ſinewes of this warre, (if a warre ſhall be) muſt be a good cauſe, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and Souldiours ſtout and fearing GOD, <hi>who cannot bee found out by gold, but will be able to find out gold,</hi> as ſome writers about this have ſpoken well.</p>
            <p>Our fourth Tranſgreſsion is from our papers and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and namely againſt <hi>an Information from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Kingdome of Scotland, to the Kingdome of England.</hi> Many things have been written on both ſides, but in very different manner: inaſmuch as the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the prelats and their partiſans, are full of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, detractions, injuries, and ſlanders againſt this Kingdome, and full of ſedition, to ſtirre up our King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; much written, that our defence is unlawfull, nothing againſt the unlawfulneſſe of the invaſion: But our writings are full of al kinds of reverence to the Kings Majesty, and of reſpect to the Engliſh Nation, preſsing the matter in hand without digreſsion or falling from the purpoſe upon the perſons of men, further then the action intended againſt our adverſaries the authors of all theſe evills, did inforce us. The for me of anſwering our Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, not by evidencing any untruth or undutifulneſſe in it, but by Proclamation, and by fire and faggot, is indeed for the time the most eaſie, the moſt compendious, and the moſt affrighting way to the poore ignorant multitude. But <hi>England</hi> can tell, that the truth cannot be conſumed by fire, but will riſe more pure and clear out of the aſhes,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17384:79"/>and flye with multiplyed wings further abroad in the world, then before. We might alſo without preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have expected, that an Information coming not from a particular perſon, or ſociety, but from a Kingdome, would have found with the Councell of <hi>England</hi> ſome better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: But we truſt our Informations will be more precious in the ſight of our friends, who know through what difficulties they make their journey, and what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance they find at their arrivall.</p>
            <p>The next three Tranſgreſsions are about the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and certain Fortifications. Out-rages and violences we have committed againſt none of that Caſtle: but many have we endured out of a deſire and hope of peace, and for them have returned courteſies and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Materials to the Caſtle were not denyed; till, by boaſting, profeſsion was made of that which wee might have known before, that it was to be turned againſt our ſelves and the Town: neither then were they altogether denyed, ſo farre as our own neceſſary uſe of materialls would permit. Neither was any work rayſed againſt the Caſtle, but a Rampier onely for defence of a Court d' guard, till violence was done from the Caſtle. Our deſire and hope of peace, and our unwillingneſſe, by the ſmalleſt breach, to loſe the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thankes of our former obedience, have moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us to ſupererogate, and to doe more then wee were oblidged, but have not ſuffered us to be defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. It is rather to bee wondered at, that wee have done ſo much, to make up a Fortification againſt our ſelves, and to put weapons in the hands of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, then to bee reprooved, that we have done no more.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:17384:80"/>
            <p>The eight concerning the <hi>Lord of Southesk,</hi> and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of quality, except <hi>Sir Lewes Stewart,</hi> we remit to the information of their own Letters, come to his Majeſties knowledge. The carriage of Noblemen, of Barons, and of the Magiſtrats of the town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> upon the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe accident of their ſurprizall by the multitude, doth rather deſerve thanks, then challenge from themſelves, or any other, as is contained in our Remonſtrance pag. <hi>32.</hi> their ſafety in the time, and their Liberty granted them ſince, how ſoon they could be in ſafety, are reall teſtimonies that no evill was meant againſt them: We would not have it ſuppoſed, that we do all that we are able to do, or what we do for good, that it is done for evill.</p>
            <p>The ninth concerning <hi>the rendring of the Towne of Edinburgh into the hands of a Committee, and therby the incurring the guilt of high Treaſon:</hi> we wonder how any ſhould be found ſo wicked as to invent it, and much more if his Majeſty, or any wiſe or good man, can be moved to believe it; They have the honour to be the firſt Citty of this his Majeſties Kingdome, and as a principall member do joyn in this common cauſe of mutuall defence: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know of any ſuch uſurping Committee, nor of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to any power, beſide that of their Soveraigne Lord and King: how ready the Magiſtrats and whole Body of that Town have been to all good offices for his Majeſties honour, how far they have ſtrained and ſpent themſelves upon publick works for the honour of the Kingdome, how difficult commandements they have obeyed at his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties pleaſure, and how they have omitted nothing which they conceived could be brought within the compaſſe of the duty of humble and faithfull Subjects; Theſe who ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time profeſſed themſelves to be their friends, but are now become their enemies, can bear witneſſe. We may truly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17384:80"/>with them, and in their name honour them with this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; that as it is his Majeſties glory to have one prime City in this his Kingdome, ſo have they beſide all other reſpects, by their affections and deportments, deſerved to be the firſt, and to have a better place in his Majeſties eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, then to be ſuſpect of Rebellion or Treaſon. Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this kind are deviſed to be diviſions betwixt the King and his beſt Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Tenth Tranſgreſsion is keeped to <hi>the laſt place, Decumanus fluctus,</hi> as a great wave to over whelme us and our Cauſe; But we have no fear ſo long as we ſaile in the ſhip of a good conſcience, which by no ſurge or ſtorme can be wrecked. This is that French Letter ſo much talked of, and inſiſted upon, as to open a gate to let in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain power to rule over <hi>England</hi> and our ſelves; which, by what conſequence it can be inferred, we would fain know; when a people is ſore diſtreſſed by ſea and land, is it unlawfull by the Law of God and man, to call for help from God, and man? Is there no help nor aſsiſtance by interceſsion, by ſupply of money, &amp;c? Is all aſsiſtance by the ſword and by men? Is all imploring of aſsiſtance an argument of ſubjection unto the aſsiſtant? May not friends and equalls aſsiſt as well as ſuperiors? Shall it be thought that diverſe Princes and Eſtates ſued unto for help, are all invited to be rulers and governours over one and the ſame people? We love not ſhrouds nor diſguiſements; we ſpeak the plain truth, and feare nothing ſo much as that truth be not known; We never had intention to preferre any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain power, to our native King whom God hath ſet over us. We love not our ſelves or the Engliſh Nation ſo little, as to raiſe up any wall of partition between them and us. The Proclamation at that time, as may be ſeen in our laſt Remonſtrancepag. <hi>34.</hi> was without example. Great forces
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17384:81"/>by ſea and land were coming upon us, Informations went abroad in other nations, to the prejudice of us and our Cauſe. This made us to reſolve to write unto the French King, apprehending that upon ſiniſter relation, his power might be uſed againſt us, as may be ſeen in our Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, printed in our Remonſtrance, pag. <hi>37.</hi> What kind of aſsiſtance we called for, whether of men or mediation, may be beſt known by the Commentary of our Letter, our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which are ready to be ſeen, and are ſigned alſo by the Lord <hi>Lowdouns</hi> hand now in priſon, and therefore (if we ſhould need to ſay it) not falſified; without ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or ſoveraignitie of either of the Nations, <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>France.</hi> Aide and aſsiſtance hath been given in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, If we had called at that time, or have called now in the return of our troubles upon <hi>Denmark, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sweden, Poland,</hi> or other Nations for help, are we therefore inviting them all to ſoveraignitie over us? And when all is ſaid or done, the Letter was but an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio</hi> for ſaken in the birth, as containing ſome unfit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions, and not agreeable to our Inſtructions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſlighted by the Subſcribers, but catched for ſome great advantage by this treacherous and ſecret accuſer of the Kingdome. Another Letter was formed conſonant to the Inſtructions, and ſigned by many hands: But neither was this ſent from us (although ſome invent or imagine, that it was intercepted by the way to <hi>France</hi> would be but late to avert the danger which was ſo neere. The Letter it ſelf ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth two tokens, that is, was unperfected; one, that it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a date; another, that it beareth no ſuperſcription from us: Both theſe are craftily turned againſt us: The blank date hath made our enemies to number this Letter amongſt our pretended faults committed after the Parliament,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17384:81"/>where as it is univerſally known that it was written in May <hi>1639.</hi> before our marching to the Border, and therefore ought to have been buried in the pacification; This is well known to the Commiſsioner, who talked of it before his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>England,</hi> &amp; was occaſionally made known to ſome of quality in his Majeſties Camp. The want of the ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath made them to indorſe it <hi>Au Roy,</hi> a title, ſay they uſed by the ſubjects of that Kingdome to their own Prince only: But we affirme, that the Letter was neither ſealed, folded, nor written on the back by us, or by our knowledge: &amp; we hold it but a poore argument &amp; ground of accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch:</hi> ſupplicating or writing to our King, if they ſhould ſay, <hi>To the King,</hi> every King being <hi>the King</hi> in his own Dominions. We love not to harp more upon ſubſcribing, ſuperſcribing, or ſending of letters to other Princes, &amp; to the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf from examples of old &amp; of late, which are not hid from the eyes of the world: It is ſufficient to us to have juſtified our ſelves, &amp; to ſhow how innocently the Lord <hi>Lowdoun</hi> ſuffereth, for putting his hand to ſuch a Letter, the guiltines or innocencie here, not being perſonall or proper to the Lord <hi>Lowdoun,</hi> but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and common to us all. And although it had been a fault, &amp; his alone, yet what ſoever it was, it did in time, &amp; for along time go before his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion &amp; imployment, &amp; therfore ought not to have bin challenged till he had retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his country, unclothed himſelf of his commiſsion, &amp; turned again to be what he was, a privat Nobleman. The dignity &amp; ſafety of nations, kingdomes, Eſtates &amp; Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are much intereſſed in their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners &amp; Legats (whether they be ſent from one Prince to another, or from a kingdom province or republick to their own Prince, Their dignity: for what is done to the Legat, is interpreted to be done to them that ſent him;their ſafety, becauſe if Legats be wronged, there can be no more compoſing of differences, nor
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17384:82"/>poſsibility of Reconciliation, which is the ground of the Law of Nations, whoſe being conſiſts in their honour and ſafety, and therefore it will have no Legat to be accuſed during his Legation for any thing committed by him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it, It commands Legats to be free even from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Law of Repriſall, and doeth reckon theſe to be the excellent effects which it produceth in all places where it is obeyed: Religion to God, Pietie toward our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, propulſation of injurie, keeping of faith, and that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats be inviolable. And although there were not ſuch a Law of Nations, yet his Majeſties own roy all and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable warrant for the coming of our Commiſsioners to his preſence at this time, is enough for their ſafe conduct and ſecurity. If they have committed any thing at home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their King, Countrey, or any particular ſubject, the fundamentall Liberties and indepencie of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the practiſes of the former times ſince <hi>1603.</hi> not onely in the perſons of Noblemen, but of others of mean quality, doe require; that they be tryed and judged at home in a Legall way by the ordinary Judicatories of the Land. How many bloody warres, and what horrible calamities have enſued upon this tranſgreſsion of the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we leave to be remembred from the Records of hiſtory, and earneſtly intreat for their liberty and ſafety, who are to us as our ſelves.</p>
            <p>When the wittineſſe and malice of our adverſaries are vented to the uttermoſt against all our proceedings ſince the pacification (for things done before on either ſide ought not to be remembred; not that we fear a new try all but becauſe they are unty mous and impertinent) By that which we have ſaid and repreſented, the unpartiall, and ſuch as are not praepoſſeſſed, will find, that till the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ending of the Aſſembly, and the proroguing of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17384:82"/>not onely the bonds of piety to God, loyaltie to our King, and zeal to be approved of our neighbours; but our deſire, our care and hope, that all ſhould end in a ſetled peace, did oblige and tye us to bear many injuries, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct all, ſo far as was poſsible, to the better part, and to do many things beyond the bounds of duty or obligation; having alwayes before our eyes, that we were dealing with our King, who by time would perceive the plots of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that our deſireable peace being obtained, would be abundant ſatisfaction for all our ſufferings, and being confident in God, that by his providence and the richeſſe of his goodneſſe, all our loſſes might in a ſhort time be repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And ſince the proroguing of the Parliament, we have followed after peace, in ſending our Commiſsioners to be mediatours of peace, by remonſtrating the reaſonableneſſe of our humble deſires, and as we ſtill do beg peace, ſo have we done nothing, but put our ſelves in order againſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and unjuſt violence; which if we had expected, or if we had not been tranſported with the love of peace, and of our King as a Prince of peace, would we have taken ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball expreſsions at the Camp, for a ground work to build our peace upon? would we have ſlipped from our advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and put the Caſtles and Strengths of the Kingdome into our enemies hands? would we without precedent in this Kingdome, have yeelded at this time to the proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parliament, or would we have received an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh garriſon with armes and ammunition into the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh?</hi> All theſe have we done, and all theſe this day are turned and uſed againſt us, and yet are we blamed to be the breakers of the peace. But becauſe this is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion proponed in the beginning, if the ballance of every juſt judgement ſtand not right already, we ſhall now by a ſhort ſummary and recapitulation of what we have done,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17384:83"/>and what we have ſuſtained, ſince the pacification, make the weight more ſenſible. It will eaſe us not a little when we ſhall ſee them weighed in the ſcales of unpartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and ſhall hear the ſentence pronounced, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations againſt us, are found light and of no moment in compariſon of this counter poiſe of our performances and juſt grievances.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17384:86"/>or to us here concerning the reaſons of our demands, whether they ſatisfie or not, but a declaration given out, denouncing a warre, and armies coming upon us.</p>
                        <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (which was called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſentence of the Councel, animated by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the Commiſsioner, that it was fit to uſe force againſt us) hath not ſeen juſt cauſe of warre, or of giving moneyes for war, and ſo to enter in a nationall quarrell, and therefore is broken up; and yet the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ceaſeth not.</p>
                        <p>By this time it may bee evident how matters ſtand, all being brought to a worſe condition then at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; nothing done nor granted for the enjoying of our Religion and liberties, but all the means which have been uſed by us, not onely before the Aſſembly and Parliament, but even in the Aſsembly, ſo peaceably ended with the conſent of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, are cenſured for Rebellion, Treaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of authoritie: Large profeſsion is made before God and the world, of a conſtant intention, that wee ſhall enjoy our Religon and liberties, and more then this, we nor do nor did ever deſire: how then cometh it that wee reſt not ſatisfied, ſince his Majeſtie is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to grant all our deſire? The fallacie may bee ſoone ſeen: The Declaration profeſseth, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie never did hinder us from the enjoying of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, &amp;c. becauſe his Majeſtie is ſtill in the opinion, at leaſt our enemies would have it to appear, that the Service Book, the Canons, Epiſcopacie, are nothing againſt our Religion. And therefore would grant us a Religion, that may conſiſt with them and take them all within the compaſse of it: In this ſenſe the <hi>Lutherans,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17384:86"/>Arminians, Papiſts</hi> were they our Superiours, would grant us the enjoying of our Religion, becauſe they conceive it not to be Religion wherein we differ from them: and Politicks pleaſe themſelves with a few prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion, &amp; what is over thoſe, to be but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous or indifferent: And where it may be oppoſed, that his Majeſtie grants the enjoying of our Religion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties according to our Eccleſiaſtical and civil laws, the ſame deception doth recurre, and can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, till determination paſse in Aſsembly and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, what are Religion and liberties by our laws: This was therefore the ſumme of our deſires from the beginning, which his Majeſtie was alſo graciouſly pleaſed to grant, but when the Aſsembly hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened and determined: And when it beginneth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what the determination of the Parliament is like to be; then all is called and counted rebellion, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and contempt of authoritie in the Aſsembly and Parliament, although proceeding ſoberly, poſedly, and upon ſuch grounds as were furniſhed by the lawes of the Kirk and Kingdome: This is the round that wee have runne, and wee are led back to the point at which we had our beginning. A circular courſe which forteth well with the adviſe profeſsed in a diviſive meeting in the time of the Parliament, and ſince diſcovered: I will never bee an adviſer of his Majeſtie to invade this Kingdome by hoſtility, but to make ſhows upon our bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that we may be ever in armes, our means may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and we inpoveriſhed, that ſo the King at laſt may obtain his ends: which is to turne this work into <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopes</hi>

                        <p>Seeing then that our humble deſires of enjoying our Religion and Liberties, are the ſame which they were from the beginning: Religion principally, and things civill for Religion; that for obtaining them wee have not ſtrayed from the fair and ſtraight way of legall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe by Aſſembly and Parliament, which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie injuſtice did promiſe at the pacification. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other demands, about matters Civill, although it be moſt certaine from by gone experience, that the corruption and thraldome of the Parliament hath been the occaſion of the corruption and thraldome of our Kirk; That by our Records it is out of queſtion, that the cognition and deciſion of the articles, doeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to the Parliament; and that in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: we have proceeded upon no other grounds, but the Lawes and laudable practices of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, never queſtioned before, but inviolably obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the onely rule of government: yet leſt preſſing any of thoſe too much, we ſhould worke contrary to our own ends, and fruſtrate our ſelves of our deſired peace; It hath been ſhowne to his Majeſtie, that theſe demands were but motions and propoſitions made to the Lords of Articles to be by them prepared for the Parliament, where they might have their finall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from his Majeſtie and the Eſtates, as might ſerve moſt for the well-publicke, without trenching upon his Majeſties authority.
